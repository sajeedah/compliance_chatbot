The objective of revising FATF Recommendation 16 (R.16) is to adapt the FATF Standards to changes in payment domain in the past decades, including variety of different products and services, types of market participants, business models, technologies and messaging standards, as well as to the evolving risks and vulnerabilities that emanate from those. The FATF strives to keep the Standards technology-neutral and to follow the principle of ‘same activity, same risk, same rules’. This update is also a part of the G20 Priority Action Plan on making crossborder payments faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive, while maintaining their safety and security. 2. As payment chains have grown more fragmented with the arrival of new players, and new technologies, it has often become more difficult for financial institutions to have sufficient information to identify suspicious activity and comply with sanctions and for law enforcement authorities to access relevant information. The nature of illicit finance threats has also evolved, with fraud now constituting a major predicate crime for money laundering. 3. The updated R.16 addresses these issues by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of different players involved in the payment chain and improving the content and quality of basic originator and beneficiary information in payment messages. This will help achieve greater transparency and more efficient and effective AML/CFT controls by financial institutions and authorities fighting financial crime. 4. Throughout the process, the FATF has considered implications that the revision of R.16 could have on various policy objectives, such as financial inclusion, data protection and privacy, and speed/cost of payments. In this context, the FATF has sought to build on the feedback received from stakeholders to strike a balance between different policy objectives while maximising the effectiveness and proportionality of new obligations under R.16. Key examples of this effort include:  revised information requirements, which include the use of year of birth as a fallback option in absence of a full date of birth; and targeted address requirement for beneficiaries: only country and town name;  flexible alignment check obligations, which include clearer responsibilities for beneficiary FIs and the possibility of checking alignment via pre-validation checks, post-validation checks, or holistic monitoring; and  a targeted regime for cross-border cash withdrawals, that focuses on increasing transparency on cardholders while minimising the disruption and data protection and privacy risks. 5.

Considering the importance and potential impact of the new obligations, the FATF will continue to engage with stakeholders to promote the implementation of the revised R.16 through a number of initiatives, including by setting up a public-private advisory group (the Payment Advisory Group), coordination with other standardsetters and global organisations, and the development of a guidance paper on payment"}

Second public consultation 6. The FATF conducted a second public consultation on proposed revisions to R.16 in February - April 20251. The FATF received significant number of responses to the public consultation. The FATF is highly grateful to those who commented and engaged in discussions through formal and informal outreaches - your technical expertise and willingness to engage has been invaluable in refining and improving FATF's proposals, and it demonstrates the value of the partnership between public and private sectors on AML/CFT. 7. Following the public consultation, the FATF has worked through the main issues in a dedicated Policy Development Group meeting in May 2025. These discussions have produced an updated R.16 revision that takes into account the issues raised and strikes a better balance between key policy objectives to make payments faster, cheaper, and more accessible, as well as safer and more secure. 8. This note outlines the main issues in the revised R.16 and its Interpretive Note (INR.16), including how the FATF has reflected the feedback received through the consultation. The final text reflects the feedback received through the two public consultations. It also provides more information on questions of policy intent. This note does not constitute a binding part of the FATF Standards or formal guidance on their application. 3.Key Issues addressed in the adopted text Structural changes 9. FATF members have sought to make structure changes to the Interpretive Note to R.16 (INR.16) with the aim of better articulating the interaction between different overlapping provisions. The new structure differentiates the responsibilities and obligations for different types of payments or value transfers and simplifies interaction of rules, exceptions, and alternative measures (see INR.16 Section C. Information requirements). The revised R.16/INR.16 also differentiates the requirements based on the types of activities rather than types of entities. A majority of respondents to the second public consultation welcomed the clarity brought by the new structure. Updates to objectives section 10. The objective section was updated to better reflect the full scope of R.16’s purpose and goals. Due to its original historical context, the Recommendation includes an emphasis on terrorism financing. The section has been further enriched to also include a direct reference to United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) relating to the prevention, suppression, and disruption of proliferation financing and to combatting fraud."}

The section has been further enriched to also include a direct reference to United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) relating to the prevention, suppression, and disruption of proliferation financing and to combatting fraud. Furthermore, members also agreed to explicatively state in the objective section (paragraph 2 of INR.16) that it is not the FATF’s intention of requiring R.16 to negatively affect financial inclusion. Respondents viewed these changes positively, especially the recognition of fraud as a key target predicate offence to combat. 1 A First public consultation was undertaken in February-May 2024."}

The updated INR.16 includes a new footnote seeking to enhance clarity and assist financial institutions in reducing one of the key sources of friction in payments cited in consultation responses, real-time sanctions screening, especially in what regards instant payment systems. The new footnote (footnote 49 of paragraph 1(c), INR.16) in the Objective section, clarifies that R.16 does not itself require real-time sanctions screening. This footnote should be understood as a clarification of R.16 obligations that does not change the scope of existing targeted financial sanctions (TFS) requirements under the FATF Standards. Under the FATF Standards and UNSCRs, core responsibilities of private entities in the implementation of TFS are to freeze without delay the funds or other assets of, and to ensure that no funds or other assets are made available to designated persons or entities. The modality of TFS screening to be conducted by private sector entities is not set out in the FATF Standards but rather in national regulation or industry best practices. 12. Respondents to the second consultation feedback noted that while the new footnote provides helpful clarity, its impact could be limited by national TFS regimes that require in practice the real-time screening of TFS-relevant information in payment messages (e.g., name). The FATF will consider this feedback in upcoming FATF Guidance paper and other relevant work with a view to minimise disruptive impacts on payment systems. Information requirements for Cross-border payments or value transfers (above the de minimis threshold) 13. The FATF has identified the need to restore transparency as it has been eroded by the fast pace of change in the payments sector. Closer alignment in the information requirements for both originator and beneficiary seek to foster symmetry in payments, enable more efficient compliance by financial institutions as well as timely access to information needed by FIUs/Law enforcement authorities (LEAs). 14. Paragraph 9 of INR.16 prescribes the core information requirements, the required originator and beneficiary information, that should accompany a cross-border payment or value transfer above applicable de minimis thresholds. During the second public consultation, respondents asked for more clarity on verification requirements. The FATF notes that on the data points under paragraph 9 of INR.16, ordering financial institutions need to send originator information that has been verified for accuracy. However, ordering financial institutions are not required to verify the accuracy of the beneficiary information, but merely include the information that was provided by"}

However, ordering financial institutions are not required to verify the accuracy of the beneficiary information, but merely include the information that was provided by the originator or was otherwise conveyed to the ordering financial institutions (e.g., “pull payments”, verification of payee schemes, etc). Then, as required under paragraph 29 of INR.16, if the identity has not been previously verified, beneficiary financial institutions should verify the beneficiary’s identity in cases where the transfers are above the de minimis threshold. 15. Respondents to the public consultations also raised issues concerning each data point. Further details will be explained in the upcoming Guidance paper. Address o The FATF has taken into account public consultation comments stating that requiring unverified beneficiary’s full address information would cause frictions and raise data protection and privacy concerns, without a sufficient material benefit. Accordingly, the FATF has decided to require only the country and town name for beneficiary, not the full address. o Regarding the address information of the originator, as proposed in the second public consultation, full address information is the default requirement while country and town name will suffice in the absence of standardised postal"}

Upcoming guidance will seek to provide further clarification to address concerns related to financial inclusion (e.g., rural/remote areas, or regions without standardised addresses). Date of birth o Date of Birth (DoB) information is required only with regard to an originator which is an individual (not for legal entities). In light of consultation feedback on the potential impact on financial inclusion, the standards have been amended to clarify that when a full DoB is not available, the year of birth only will suffice. Upcoming guidance will provide further guidance on those cases where no DoB information is available or cannot be verified (e.g., unregistered births) and on how to duly handle it (e.g., not making this information available to the final beneficiary). Connected BIC/LEI/unique official identifier o Some public consultation respondents suggested that INR.16 should refer to ‘published BICs’ rather than ‘connected BICs’, noting that identifiers in payments should be publicly available regardless of connectivity status. However, the FATF members have assessed the differences in validation and due diligence processes for obtaining and maintaining connected and nonconnected BICs, ultimately deciding to maintain ‘connected BICs’ given the former’s more robust framework. Domestic payment and value transfers 16. No changes have been made to the minimal requirements under the current R.16 that are applicable to domestic transfers, i.e., If the originator information can be made available by other means within three business days upon request from the beneficiary FI or the appropriate authority, only the originator’s account number or a transaction reference number need to accompany the payment message (paragraphs 10-12 of INR.16). Upcoming FATF guidance will seek to provide a clearer expectation on the requirements applicable to domestic transfers. Virtual account numbers 17. The use of virtual account numbers can obscure the true location of a customer’s account preventing financial institutions and authorities from identifying the true nature of a transaction (e.g., its cross-border nature). Building on the feedback received in public consultations, the FATF has decided to further strengthen the general principle2 that was proposed for the second public consultation by:  Further aligning the language with the ISO standard on IBAN, by emphasising the country where the financial institution that services the account resides; and  Complementing the general principle with a positive requirement recalling that payment messages should enable all relevant institutions and authorities to identify the respective servicing financial institutions and their countries of location."}

{"doc_name": "Explanatory_Note_R16.pdf", "anchor": "p5", "text": "5 paragraph 7 of INR.16. It is important to note that it is not the FATF’s intention to impose the inclusion of country information in all types of account numbers (e.g., those that do not include a country code) nor to ban the legitimate use of virtual account numbers (such as virtual IBANs). Cross-border Cash Withdrawals 19. With respect to cross-border cash withdrawals, the lack of systematic and efficient access to cardholder information poses challenges for the financial institutions and the jurisdictions concerned. Furthermore, international cooperation usually occurs where an inquiry or investigation is already underway and after the nexus to a foreign jurisdiction is known, while the availability of information to reporting entities enables the initial detection of suspicious activity – which may therefore go undetected if the information is not available under R.16. Gaps in the coverage of payment transparency rules may soon come to be exploited more systematically. FATF therefore does consider it necessary to address this issue with a targeted requirement for cross-border cash withdrawals. 20. These deficiencies include competent authorities facing challenges when compelling the production of the relevant information across borders. Authorities would need to make multiple requests to foreign counterpart authorities to identify the parties and the financial flows involved, in order to reach the threshold where a formal investigation can be initiated. This situation can obstruct in investigative and prosecution processes, making them at worst impossible, and at best, much slower than they would be if basic information on the cardholder existed in both jurisdictions. 21. Building on feedback from the second public consultation, FATF members have agreed to introduce a further targeted framework for cross-border cash withdrawals, focusing new obligations on the requirement to send cardholder’s name to the acquiring financial institution upon request, within three business days of receiving the request. This targeted framework will allow the FATF to avoid excessive disruption and to ensure proportionality while still tackling the prevailing opacity in cross-border cash withdrawals today and the typologies shared in the second public consultations as below. Other purposes include financial intelligence, investigation or prosecution in the jurisdiction of the suspected cross-border cash withdrawal, as FIU/LEAs need to be able to request additional information, such as cardholder name, rather than only transaction records and card numbers. Example of using cross-border cash withdrawals to conceal suspicious activity  Person X, who is normally resident in country A, opens one or"}

Example of using cross-border cash withdrawals to conceal suspicious activity  Person X, who is normally resident in country A, opens one or more accounts in countries B and C, deposits funds, and is issued payment card(s).  Person X returns to their home country A.  Person X uses their payment card(s) (issued in countries B and C) to make frequent or large cash withdrawals at ATMs in their home country A.  Under current R.16 rules, no information on the identity of the cardholder is available to financial institutions in country A. Cardholder information is available only to the issuing financial institutions in countries B and C and information about person X's activity is fragmented, preventing the detection of suspicious activity. Person X could therefore circumvent domestic AML/CFT controls by financial institutions and authorities in country A. The lack of transparency in these activities hinders the identification and reporting of suspicious activity and prevents law enforcement from accessing information as described above."}
{"doc_name": "Explanatory_Note_R16.pdf", "anchor": "p6", "text": "6 22. Additionally, the FATF received responses asking about how the information could be used or what acquiring financial institutions are expected to do with the information that would be transmitted by card issuers. As explained in footnote 59, the responsibilities under the ‘Section D- Responsibilities of ordering, intermediary, and beneficiary financial institutions’ are not applicable to the transactions of cash withdrawals. Nevertheless, the information of cardholder name would be a useful source to support the detection of structuring or other suspicious activity through ongoing monitoring. Once an acquiring financial institution detects suspicious transactions through their monitoring systems, the institution can request the cardholder name for enriched suspicious transaction reporting. FATF will clarify further in upcoming FATF Guidance what acquiring financial institutions could do with the information that would be transmitted by card issuers. 23. With this decision, FATF members have sought to align themselves with the feedback received from a high number of respondents warning that the more extensive requirements previously proposed under the former 19 (c) could have led to significant unintended consequences on cash access as well as on data protection and privacy. 24. Lastly, as per the payment chain definition (see below for further detail), it is clarified that the 'beneficiary FI' in cash withdrawals should be understood as the FI servicing or sponsoring the ATM where cash is withdrawn (Under the FATF standards a FI needs to be responsible for servicing or sponsoring the operation of an ATM, but an ATM operator which is not a FI would not be required to receive cardholder information). Exemption for card payments for purchase of goods or services 25. As a condition for the exemption for the purchase of goods or services using a payment card,3 it was proposed in February 2024 that additional information, ‘the name and location of the issuing and acquiring financial institutions’, should accompany the transfer in addition to the card number. In the February 2024 proposal, it was also proposed to clarify that the card exemption only applies to purchases of goods or services “from merchants”, and does not apply to person-to-person transfers made using payment cards. These proposals reflected concerns that the use of the card exemption had gone beyond its original intended scope and was enabling uncontrolled cross-border transfers, circumventing the travel rule requirements. In addition, the inclusion of issuer and acquirer information sought to unambiguously identify the specific FIs that"}

In addition, the inclusion of issuer and acquirer information sought to unambiguously identify the specific FIs that have customer relationships with the cardholder and merchant in a given purchase, to facilitate the process of obtaining further details by FIUs/LEAs when necessary. 26. Building on feedback received in the first public consultation and engagement with card networks, the FATF has agreed to ensure access to information on the issuer’s and acquirer’s name and location by leveraging existing information directory systems developed or to be developed by card networks. FIs’ access to this information will enable FIUs and Law Enforcement Authorities to access this information through them and upon request. By not requiring this information to be included in card payment messages, the FATF seeks to ensure the proportionality of the new requirement given the very high cost the inclusion of this information in card payment messages would have (e.g., having to change the standard or develop parallel mechanisms). 27. The FATF has sought also, in lieu of a definition, to clarify the scope of the exemption for goods or services by adding a footnote (footnote 54 for paragraph 16 of 3 Credit or debit or prepaid cards."}
{"doc_name": "Explanatory_Note_R16.pdf", "anchor": "p7", "text": "7 INR.16) that expands on what is meant by ‘purchase of goods or services’. This text delineates the scope of the card exemption, without providing excessive details in the standards. In this context, it is important to note that, as in the current R.16, the exemption will apply to card-based purchases of goods and services.4 In cases where cards are used to fund other types of payment or value transfer (e.g. a person-to-person transfer), the relevant payment or value transfer information requirements will apply. FATF will clarify in the upcoming Guidance what could be included in other types of payment or value transfer beyond a person-to-person transfer. 28. Respondents to the second public consultation broadly welcomed the updated text, the removal of the term 'merchant', and the proportionality of leveraging directory services instead of requiring this data to be in payment messages (which would be very costly) or in parallel mechanisms requiring creating new channels. It is important to note that most respondents highlighted that the future cooperation of card networks will be crucial for the implementation of this new requirement. It should be noted that the decision to drop the term ‘merchant’ relates to the feedback received in the first public consultation and which warned that no definition could be sufficiently comprehensive—and that introducing one risked causing unintended consequences for acquiring financial institutions’ existing merchant due-diligence practices. Application of R.16 to instant payments 29. The FATF has also examined the possibility of extending the exemption to purchases of goods or services using instant payments, but decided not to proceed with such an extension. This decision reflects the fact that payments mechanisms, including instant payments, are still evolving and innovating rapidly in many regions worldwide and do not represent a single stable model, with a degree of variability in the risk factors and control mechanisms (e.g., the different use cases, transaction amounts, reversibility). 30. The FATF underlines that the current standards already allow instant payments for goods and services to benefit from the more lenient regimes for domestic payments and for cross-border payments below a de-minimis threshold. A large majority of transactions on instant payment systems benefit from lighter requirements under one or both of these regimes. The FATF will support the implementation of de minimis thresholds as part of its upcoming guidance work, with a goal of promoting financial inclusion. 31. Nevertheless, the FATF would like to highlight the"}

Nevertheless, the FATF would like to highlight the importance of fostering responsible innovation, including by ensuring that instant payment systems foresee sufficient transparency and robust AML/CFT/CPF controls (e.g., leveraging modern analytics and richer data flows supported by ISO 20022). 32. Building on the above, and recognising the fast pace of evolution in the payment sector, and the feedback received on the increasingly important role of instant payments, the FATF will continue to closely monitor developments across the sector, and more generally in the payments domain. The FATF will, as a priority, conduct further work on the risks and controls applicable to different payment mechanisms, in order to more closely align the requirements of Recommendation 16 applicable to purchases of goods or services using different payment mechanisms, including instant payments. Future work on this topic will take into account the evolving risk landscape, the effectiveness of AML/CFT and fraud controls in different channels, and the goal of promoting responsible innovation, a level playing field, and safe and inclusive payments. 4 Domestic and cross-border."}
{"doc_name": "Explanatory_Note_R16.pdf", "anchor": "p8", "text": "8 De minimis threshold 33. FATF members have agreed to better delineate the scope of the de minimis threshold in paragraph 8 (cross-border transfers) and 10 (domestic transfers) of INR.16, further clarifying its applicability to both cross-border and domestic transfers (but not to the targeted requirement applied to cross-border cash withdrawals). Countries will continue to be able to impose lower, risk-based requirements for domestic payments and cross-border payments no higher than USD/EUR 1,000. See above (paragraph 11) for further detail on the requirements applicable in domestic payments. 34. Respondents to the second public consultation called for additional clarity on how the de minimis thresholds relate to other thresholds, such as those on occasional transactions or what actions jurisdictions could take to minimise financial exclusion risks. The FATF will seek to address these concerns in upcoming guidance work. Verification of alignment of information 35. The FATF has decided to introduce alignment checks obligations by listing a number of options for FIs to implement alignment checks, namely post-validation checks, holistic ongoing monitoring, and pre-validation checks (such as Confirmation of Payee-systems). It is worth noting that FIs’ pre or post-validation checks are intended to take place for each transaction while holistic monitoring should be ongoing. The addition of this last option reflects private sector feedback highlighting the effectiveness of holistic monitoring frameworks seeking to detect anomalous accounts, transactions and activity leveraging a number of data points and factors, including misaligned beneficiary information. Overall, the outcome of these checks should inform the need for any follow-up action by the beneficiary FI. 36. FATF has also sought to clarify the notion of alignment by refining what \"alignment\" means, in order to be clear that it is a flexible and graduated concept, sensitive to risk and context, and is not limited to exact name-matching. Lastly, these new obligations have been included as a continuation of the current section on obligations for beneficiary FIs, with detecting misdirected payments also added to the chapeau in paragraph 30 of INR.16. 37. Second public consultation responses were mixed with many respondents misunderstanding the proposed framework on pre-validation checks, Confirmation of Payee / Verification of Payee (CoP/VoP), as mandating CoP/VoP for all ordering FIs always. This was in contrast with FATF’s actual intent of introducing a flexible requirement that could be met through either pre or post-validation checks. In addition, respondents noted that while CoP held considerable promise in domestic contexts,"}

This was in contrast with FATF’s actual intent of introducing a flexible requirement that could be met through either pre or post-validation checks. In addition, respondents noted that while CoP held considerable promise in domestic contexts, it had limited availability yet for cross-border transactions. This contrasted with responses to the first public consultation, which strongly advocated for aligning FATF’s first to ongoing efforts to expand pre-validation schemes. Considering this, many private sector stakeholders proposed the introduction of a third option to check alignment in the form of holistic ongoing monitoring as existing frameworks are already effectively leveraging misalignment of information, amongst other factors. The revised text reflects this advice, while the modifications which were first introduced in the second public consultation and warmly welcomed by respondents, (such as a targeted scope for alignment (name and account number) and the ability to leverage pre-validation solutions where available) have been retained.5 5 The use of pre-validation checks is allowed in cases where the ordering and beneficiary FIs both participate in a pre-validation mechanism that enables them to check for each transaction that the name and account number of the beneficiary in the payment message."}

The number and value of fraud cases has grown significantly in recent years, and fraud is now the dominant type of proceedsgenerating crime globally, as set out in recent FATF reports, such as Illicit Financial Flows from Cyber-Enabled Fraud (2023).6 This flexible requirement would align with the growing body of positive experiences with implementing holistic monitoring frameworks and CoP/VoP at, and also help reduce errors and mis-directed payments, a major source of friction. The proposal’s emphasis on flexibility also reflects the importance of ensuring that FIs and jurisdictions which are not able to implement one of the options for alignment checks do not suffer any loss of access to payment systems as a result. Definition of the payment chain 39. The February 2024 consultation proposal contained two options: The payment chain should be considered to begin with the financial institution which receives an instruction from the customer (instruction route); or with the financial institution from which, the customer’s funds are provided (funding route). Public consultation feedback pointed out that the funding route would make implementation significantly more complicated and was ill-suited for increasingly complex and hybrid payment chains. Respondents also noted the instruction route would be better positioned to clarify responsibilities in modern payment chains, as well as being a flexible approach in a rapidly evolving market. Based on this feedback, FATF has agreed that the payment chain begins with the financial institution which receives an instruction from the customer (in paragraph 6 of INR.16), and ends with the financial institution that services the account of the beneficiary or provides cash to the beneficiary7. 40. A majority of respondents to the second public consultation welcomed FATF’s clarification on the instruction route. Nonetheless, many called for additional guidance on how the new definition would apply to various scenarios. For example, one respondent considered the diagram that was included in the Explanatory Memorandum (see below) and questioned what would be the end of the payment chain in cases where both MVTS G and Bank E have account relationships with Customer Y, claiming that MVTS G should be the end point of the payment chain as it services an account of the beneficiary. 41.

On this point, it is noteworthy that an important element of the R.16 is that the required information must be included in a payment instruction, and must flow from the start to the end of the payment or value transfer. MVTS providers are increasingly collecting and disbursing funds through electronic means. The start and end points may therefore not be traditional bank accounts, but could also include such as payment accounts and electronic money wallets. It is important to ensure that the required originator and beneficiary information can travel the whole length of a cross-border payment chain, rather than being fragmented among a series of discrete payments. Otherwise, cross-border payment chains are often, in effect, broken into two or more domestic transfers, with the result that the financial institutions involved may not have the full information required on the ultimate originator and / or beneficiary. It has become common for MVTS or other service providers to send transfers to other financial institutions without specifying the name of the ultimate originator, and customers may send transfers to these providers without specifying the ultimate beneficiary. In practice, this may also result in obscuring the ultimate jurisdiction of origin or destination, thereby impeding screening and monitoring, as well as 6 https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/reports/Illicit-financial-flows-cyber-enabled-fraud.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf 7 R.16 requires that a payment instruction for cross-border transfers includes the information of account number of the beneficiary, or in the absence of an account, a unique transaction reference number should be included."}

When referring to the financial institution that services the account of the beneficiary, it is intended to be the account which settles the payment or value transfer with the beneficiary. 42. FATF will seek to provide additional clarity in the upcoming guidance also on other cases involving complicated or hybrid payment chains (e.g., involving virtual assets and fiat currency), and which were raised by respondents to the consultation. Origin of funds 43. Following the adoption of the instruction route as the start of the payment chain, FATF members have agreed on a footnote to ensure that information on the origin of a transaction’s funds be included in payment messages. 44. The policy objective of the proposed footnotes is to address a specific typology where a payment is sent through a financial institution with which the customer does not maintain an account with the funds to be sent, and therefore the transaction is funded ad-hoc from an account with a different FI. In this situation the account which is the true origin of the funds would not be indicated in the payment message, and this could enable evasion of risk-based controls. In such cases, footnote 50 for paragraph 8 (b) and footnote 51 for paragraph 9 (b) of INR.16 will ensure that information on the account (i.e., account number and the name of FI) which is the ultimate origin of the funds is included in the payment information, to ensure the FI which does have an ongoing account-based relationship with the customer, and from which the funds for the specific transaction were drawn, can always be identified. Clarification of net settlement & bundled transactions 45. The FATF members have agreed to confirming that no unbundling by intermediary FIs is required, further clarifying that even if unbundling and screening by intermediary FIs is not required, the underlying payments or value transfers are still subject to the requirements of Recommendation 16, along their respective payment chains. FATF’s proposal was warmly welcomed by respondents to the second public consultation as striking a balance between clarifying the requirements applicable to underlying transactions without imposing new costly requirements for intermediary FIs participating in net settlements. 46. The rule can be explained further, building on the diagrams included in the February 2024 consultation:"}

Bank C will have no obligations under Recommendation 16 regarding the net settlement it conducts on behalf of Banks B and D, as these will be FI-to-FI transfers covered under the revised net settlement conditions. 48. Regarding the underlying transactions bundled in the aggregated transfer, Bank A, MVTS F, MVTS G and Bank E will continue to be bound by their CDD duties, as applicable. Refinement of Glossary definitions 49. The February 2024 proposal introduced a number of new specific terms. Most of these terms sought to either add clarity to existing obligations or to support new additions to the INR.16. A non-exhaustive list of examples included BIC; LEI; Unique Official Identifiers, MVTS network; and updates to the notions of Ordering and Beneficiary FIs. Respondents to the public consultation asked for additional granularity to be included, e.g., on what is meant by \"FI\", \"merchant\", \"transfer\" and \"address\". Others sought to ensure alignment with existing industry standards, such as with SWIFT’s definitions of cover payments. 50. FATF members agreed to minimal further changes to the proposed glossary definitions and only when required by decisions set out in this explanatory Note. These include the removal of the definition of \"merchant\", originally proposed in February 2024; and better targeting the definition of ordering FI to reflect the chosen definition of payment chain (instruction route). Members also agreed on including cash withdrawals in the definition of Payment or Value Transfers, further developing the applicable information requirements in the sub-section for Exceptions and Differentiated Requirements. No additional changes have been introduced to those already included in the second public consultation. 51. The revised body of INR 16 will already provide additional clarity and granularity on many of the areas requested by respondents in 2024 and 2025. However, others, such as card payments, cash withdrawals and/or information requirements (e.g. address) could be addressed in more detail in upcoming FATF guidance."}

The revised R.16 does not directly apply AML/CFT regulation to PMIs. FATF members deemed such an extension of the FATF’s standards to be outside of the current R.16 scope. Furthermore, it was also considered that such a measure could be disruptive in a moment where many PMIs worldwide are already overstretched over the demands of ISO 20022 transition. Members noted that many PMIs are already accountable to FIs as both owners and customers as well as to existing systems of supervision and oversight by national authorities. 53. Respondents to the second public consultation highlighted the importance of ensuring that PMIs have the capacity to enable payment messages to carry the required information requirements along payment chains. Amongst others, these concerns related to the limitations that may emerge in cross-border payments leveraging domestic PMIs for the last mile of a payment chain. Consultation responses noted also that some PMIs lack sufficient capacity to support end-to-end payment transparency, especially in the case of some domestic PMIs where respondents asked from the FATF further clarity on regulatory expectations. Considering this background, FATF will support the role of PMIs in enabling R.16 implementation through upcoming guidance and through engagement and coordination with payment regulators through the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). 54. Consistent with the feedback received in both public consultations, FATF has agreed not to bring VASPs directly into the scope of R.16 but to apply the updated requirements indirectly through R.15, and to continue working on travel rule implementation through the existing framework, including through the tailored framework of R.15 and the support of the FATF’s Virtual Asset Contact Group (VACG). Overall, while VASPs will have to comply with the new requirements imposed by the revised R.16, they will continue to be the target of substantial FATF support. INR.15 will be updated, if necessary, to ensure the reference to R.16’s information requirements remains up-to-date. 55. Respondents to the second public consultations welcomed FATF’s decision to keep the tailored framework under R.15 as it helps translate R.16 requirements to the particularities of the VA sector. VASP responses echoed that they already have the technology required for some of new duties (e.g., seeking to identify mis-directed payments, for example, by using pre-validation checks) and called for the FATF to include in upcoming guidance further granularity on how the recommendation"}

One of the main drivers behind the revision of recommendation 16 was to ensure a level playing field between FIs and other payment service providers, reflecting the role played by emerging payment actors, including amongst others fintech companies. Respondents to the public consultation called on the FATF to enshrine a better adapted \"same activity, same risk, same rules\" principle in order to avoid over-reliance on increasingly outdated definitions of payment chains, and to clarify that R.16 obligations are not limited only to banks. This approach would help ensure the standard remains future-proof ahead of ongoing developments in financial services. 57. FATF members echoed these views and moved to align R.16’s structure with same activity, same risk same rules principles as well as to adopt the instruction route definition of the payment chain. A focus on activity types over entity types will better capture the role of all relevant payment actors."}

Consistent implementation across jurisdictions is essential for the implementation of R.16 especially given the applications of requirements to crossborder transfers. A pre-requisite for the implementation of the revised recommendation is that same information requirements are in place in both the origin and destination countries involved in a payment or value transfer, and that the technical systems of all involved parties will support such information requirements. 59. Normal practice of FATF is that amendments take effect immediately. However, FATF recognises the need for transitional arrangements to enable private sector partners and payment market infrastructures to be adapted and made ready to implement the new requirements in an orderly way, as well as the need to provide further clarifications through upcoming FATF Guidance. Acknowledging that some of the new R.16 requirements would require time before they can be realistically implemented by jurisdictions and the private sector, the FATF has considered the need for a transition period before achieving implementation of R.16. Based on the feedback received during the second consultation, a majority of respondents agreed with the end of 2030, which has been identified as a as a realistic deadline for implementation. The FATF will expect that most, or all of the new requirements are in effect by that date. 60. However, and noting that respondents warned that some of the proposed changes may require a longer time (e.g., cash withdrawals and updates on domestic PMIs to implement the new definition of the payment chain) over the changes required to national laws, industry rules, national infrastructure and IT systems. The FATF will leverage on the creation of a public-private payment advisory group (PAG) that will assist with the development of guidance and monitor, track, and report on R.16’s implementation, including identifying the need for tailored deadlines in response to industry challenges where required (e.g., to allow sufficient time to avoid disruption).This work will also include further analysis of the different risks, use cases and features of different payment mechanisms (see paragraph 27). FATF will continue to engage with stakeholders including at PAG, to ensure effective and harmonised implementation of the revised R.16."}

Recommendation 16 has was developed with the objective of preventing terrorists, perpetrators of money laundering and associated predicate offences (e.g., fraud), and other criminals from having unfettered access to wire payments or value transfers for moving their funds, and for detecting such misuse when it occurs. Specifically, it aims to ensure that basic information on the originator and beneficiary48 of wire payments or value transfers is immediately available: (a) to appropriate law enforcement and/or prosecutorial authorities to assist them in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting terrorists, and other criminals, and tracing their assets; (b) to financial intelligence units for analysing suspicious or unusual activity, and disseminating it as necessary, and (c) to ordering, intermediary and beneficiary financial institutions to facilitate the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions, and to implement the requirements to take freezing action and comply with prohibitions from conducting transactions with designated persons and entities, as per the obligations set out in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, such as resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, and resolution 1373 (2001) relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing, and resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing.49 2. To accomplish these objectives, countries should have the ability to trace all wire payments or value transfers. Due to the potential terrorist financing threat posed by small wire payments or value transfers, countries should minimise thresholds, while taking into account the risk of driving transactions underground and the importance of financial inclusion. It is not the intention of the FATF to impose rigid standards or to mandate a single operating process that would negatively affect the payment system or financial inclusion. B. SCOPE 3. Recommendation 16 applies to cross-border and domestic wire payments or value transfers and domestic wire transfers, including serial payments, and cover payments. Differentiated obligations apply to different types of transactions, as set out in Section C. 4. Information accompanying cross-border and domestic payments or value transfers should be structured, to the extent possible, in accordance with the established standards of the system used such as ISO 20022, and should be sufficiently detailed to enable identification of the originator and beneficiary. 48 The terms \"originator\" and \"beneficiary\" are used in Recommendation 16 and its Interpretive Note.

This section sets out the applicable information requirements for domestic and cross-border transfers including differentiated requirements for certain categories of payments or value transfers. Recommendation 16 is not intended to cover the following types of payments: 6. For purposes of implementation of Recommendation 16, the payment chain starts at the financial institution that receives the instructions from the originator for transfer of funds to the beneficiary. The end point of the payment chain is the financial institution that services the account of the beneficiary or provides cash to the beneficiary. 7. Information in the payment message should make it possible for all institutions and authorities referred to in paragraph 1 to identify which financial institution is servicing the account of the originator and beneficiary respectively and in which countries these institutions are located. Financial institutions should ensure that account numbers should not be used to disguise the identification of the country where the financial institution that services the account resides. Cross-border qualifying wire payments and value transfers De-minimis threshold for cross-border wire payments and value transfers 8. Countries may adopt a de minimis threshold (no higher than USD/EUR 1,000) for cross-border wire payments or value transfers (other than cash withdrawals),. Bbelow this threshold, which the following requirements should apply countries should ensure that financial institutions include with such transfers: (a) (i) the name of the originator and beneficiary; (ii) the name of the beneficiary; and (b) (iii) an the account number for each of the originator and beneficiary, or a unique transaction reference number. where such an account is used to process the transaction.50 In the absence of an account, a unique transaction reference number should be included, which permits traceability of the transaction.

Domestic wire payments and value transfers De-minimis threshold for domestic payments or value transfers 10. Countries may also adopt a de minimis threshold (no higher than USD/EUR 1,000), for domestic payments or value transfers. Below this threshold, countries should ensure that financial institutions include with such transfers: (a) the name of the originator; and (b) the account number of the originator, or a unique transaction reference number which will permit the transaction to be traced back to the originator or the beneficiary. Such information need not be verified for accuracy, unless there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, in which case, the financial institution should verify the information pertaining to its customer.

The mandate of the FATF is to set standards and to promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation, and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. In collaboration with other international stakeholders, the FATF also works t o identify national -level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse. The FATF Recommendations set out a comprehensive and consistent framework of measures which countries should implement in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Countries have diverse legal, administrative and operational frameworks and different financial systems, and so cannot all take identical measures to counter these threats. The FATF Recommendations, therefore, set an international standard, which countries s hould implement through measures adapted to their particular circumstances. The FATF Recommendations set out the essential measures that countries should have in place to:  identify the risks, and develop policies and domestic coordination;  pursue money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation;  apply preventive measures for the financial sector and other designated sectors;  establish powers and responsibilities for the competent authorities (e.g., investigative, law enforcement and supervisory authorities) and other institutional measures;  enhance the transparency and availability of beneficial ownership information of legal persons and arrangements; and  facilitate international cooperation. The original FATF Forty Recommendations were drawn up in 1990 as an initiative to combat the misuse of financial systems by persons laundering drug money. In 1996, the Recommendations were revised for the first time to reflect evolving money laundering trends and techniques, and to broaden their scope well beyond drug-money laundering. In October 2001 the FATF expanded its mandate to deal with the issue of the funding of terrorist acts and terrorist organisations, and took the important step of creating the Eight (later expanded to Nine) Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. The FATF Recommendations were revised a second time in 2003, and these, together with the Special Recommendations, have been endorsed by over 180 countries, and are universally recognised as"}

The revisions address new and emerging threats, clarify and strengthen many of the existing obligations, while maintaining the necessary stability and rigour in the Recommendations. The FATF Standards have also been revised to strengthen the requirements for higher risk situations, and to allow countries to take a more focused approach in areas where high risks remain or implementation could be enhanced. Countries should first identif y, assess and understand the risks of money laundering and terrorist finance that they face, and then adopt appropriate measures to mitigate the risk. The risk -based approach allows countries, within the framework of the FATF requirements, to adopt a more flexible set of measures, in order to target their resources more effectively and apply preventive measures that are proportionate to the nature of risks, in order to focus their efforts in the most effective way. Combating terrorist financing is a very significant challenge. An effective AML/CFT system, in general, is important for addressing terrorist financing, and most measures previously focused on terrorist financing are now integrated throughout the Recommendations, therefore obviating the need for the Special Recommendations. However, there are some Recommendations that are unique to terrorist financing, which are set out in Section C of the FATF Recommendations. These are: Recommendation 5 (the criminalisation of terrorist financing); Recommendation 6 (targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism & terrorist financing); and Recommendation 8 (measures to prevent the misuse of nonprofit organisations). The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a lso a significant security concern, and in 2008 the FATF’s mandate was expanded to include dealing with the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. To combat this threat, the FATF has adopted a new Recommendation (Recommendation 7) aimed at ensuring consistent and effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions when these are called for by the UN Security Council. The FATF Standards comprise the Recommendations themselves and their Interpretive Notes, together with the applicable definitions in the Glossary. The measures set out in the FATF Standards"}

The FATF also produces Guidance, Best Practice Papers, and other advice to assist countries with the implementation of the FATF standards. These other documents are not mandatory for assessing compliance with the Standards, but countries may find it valuab le to have regard to them when considering how best to implement the FATF Standards.

The revision of the Recommendations has involved extensive consultation, and has benefited from comments and suggestions from these stakeholders. Going forward and in accordance with its mandate, the FATF will continue to consider changes to the standards, as appropriate, in light of new information regarding emerging threats and vulnerabilities to the global financial system. The FATF calls upon all countries to implement effective measures to bring their national systems for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation into compliance with the revised FATF Recommendations."}

AML/CFT POLICIES AND COORDINATION 1. Assessing risks and applying a risk-based approach * Countries should identify, assess, and understand the money laundering and terrorist financing risks for the country, and should take action, including designating an authority or mechanism to coordinate actions to assess risks, and apply resources, aimed at ensuring the risks are mitigated effectively. Based on that assessment, countries should apply a risk- based approach (RBA) to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are proportionate to the risks identified. This approach should be an essential foundation to efficient allocation of resources across the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the implementation of risk -based measures throughout the FATF Recommendati ons. Where countries identify higher risks, they should ensure that their AML/CFT regime adequately addresses such risks. Where countries identify lower risks, they should allow and encourage simplified measures as appropriate. Countries should also identify, assess, and understand the proliferation financing risks for the country. In the context of Recommendation 1, “proliferation financing risk” refers strictly and only to the potential breach, non-implementation or evasion of the targeted financial sanctions obligations referred to in Recommendation 7. Countries should take proportionate action aimed at ensuring that these risks are mitigated effectively, including designating an authority or mechanism to coordinate actions to assess risks, and allocate resources efficiently for this purpose. Where countries identify higher risks, they should ensure that they adequately address such risks. Where countries identify lower risks, they should ensure that the measures applied are proportionate to the level of proliferation financing risk, while still ensuring full implementation of the targeted financial sanctions as required in Recommendation 7. Countries should require financial institutions and designated non -financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) to identify, assess and take effective and risk -based action to mitigate their money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks. 2. National cooperation and coordination Countries should have national AML/CFT/CPF policies, informed by the risks1 identified, which should be regularly reviewed, and should designate an authority or have a coordination or other mechanism that is responsible for such policies. Countries should ensure that policy -makers, the financial intelligence unit (FIU), law enforcement authorities, supervisors and other relevant competent authorities, at the policymaking"}

MONEY LAUNDERING AND CONFISCATION 3. Money laundering offence * Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the Vienna Convention and the Palermo Convention. Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences. 4. Confiscation and provisional measures * Countries should ensure that they have policies and operational frameworks that prioritise asset recovery in both the domestic and international context. Taking into account the Vienna Convention, the Palermo Convention, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, and the Terrorist Financing Convention, countries should have measures, including legislative measures, to enable their competent authorities to: a) identify, trace and evaluate criminal property and property of corresponding value; b) suspend or withhold consent to a transaction; c) take any appropriate investigative measures; d) expeditiously carry out provisional measures, such as freezing and seizing, to prevent any dealing, transfer or disposal of criminal property and property of corresponding value; e) confiscate criminal property and property of corresponding value through conviction based confiscation; f) confiscate criminal property through non-conviction based confiscation; g) enforce a resulting confiscation order; and h) ensure effective management of property that is frozen, seized or confiscated."}

TERRORIST FINANCING AND FINANCING OF PROLIFERATION 5. Terrorist financing offence * Countries should criminalise terrorist financing on the basis of the Terrorist Financing Convention, and should criminalise not only the financing of terrorist acts but also the financing of terrorist organisations and individual terrorists even in the abs ence of a link to a specific terrorist act or acts. Countries should ensure that such offences are designated as money laundering predicate offences. 6. Targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism and terrorist financing * Countries should implement targeted financial sanctions regimes to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing. The resolutions require countries to freeze without delay the funds or other assets of, and to ensure that no funds or other assets are made available, directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of, any person or entity either (i) designated by, or under the authority of, the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, including in accordance with resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions; or (ii) designated by that country pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001). 7.

Non-profit organisations * Countries should identify the organisations which fall within the FATF definition of non-profit organisations (NPOs) and assess their terrorist financing risks. Countries should have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures, without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities, in line with the risk-based approach. The purpose of these measures is to protect such NPOs from terrorist financing abuse, including: (a) by terrorist organisations posing as legitimate entities; (b) by exploiting legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist financing, including for"}

PREVENTIVE MEASURES 9. Financial institution secrecy laws Countries should ensure that financial institution secrecy laws do not inhibit implementation of the FATF Recommendations. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE AND RECORD-KEEPING 10. Customer due diligence * Financial institutions should be prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in obviously fictitious names. Financial institutions should be required to undertake customer due diligence (CDD) measures when: (i) establishing business relations; (ii) carrying out occasional transactions: (i) above the applicable designated threshold (USD/EUR 15,000); or (ii) that are payments or value transfers in the circumstances covered by the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 16; (iii) there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or (iv) the financial institution has doubts about the veracity or adequacy of previously obtained customer identification data. The principle that financial institutions should conduct CDD should be set out in law. Each country may determine how it imposes specific CDD obligations, either through law or enforceable means. The CDD measures to be taken are as follows: (a) Identifying the customer and verifying that customer’s identity using reliable, independent source documents, data or information. (b) Identifying the beneficial owner, and taking reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner, such that the financial institution is satisfied that it knows who the beneficial owner is. For legal persons and arrangements this should include financial institutions understanding the ownership and control structure of the customer. (c) Understanding and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. (d) Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutiny of transactions undertaken throughout the course of that relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the customer, their business and risk profile, including, whe re necessary, the source of funds."}

Financial institutions should be required to verify the identity of the customer and beneficial owner before or during the course of establishing a business relationship or conducting transactions for occasional customers. Countries may permit financial institutions to complete the verification as soon as reasonably practicable following the establishment of the relationship, where the money laundering and terrorist financing risks are effectively managed and where this is essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business. Where the financial institution is unable to comply with the applicable requirements under paragraphs (a) to (d) above (subject to appropriate modification of the extent of the measures on a risk-based approach), it should be required not to open the accou nt, commence business relations or perform the transaction; or should be required to terminate the business relationship; and should consider making a suspicious transactions report in relation to the customer. These requirements should apply to all new customers, although financial institutions should also apply this Recommendation to existing customers on the basis of materiality and risk, and should conduct due diligence on such existing relationships at appropriate times. 11. Record-keeping Financial institutions should be required to maintain, for at least five years, all necessary records on transactions, both domestic and international, to enable them to comply swiftly with information requests from the competent authorities. Such records must be sufficient to permit reconstruction of individual transactions (including the amounts and types of currency involved, if any) so as to provide, if necessary, evidence for prosecution of criminal activity. Financial institutions should be required to keep all records obtained through CDD measures (e.g. copies or records of official identification documents like passports, identity cards, driving licences or similar documents), account files and business corr espondence, including the results of any analysis undertaken (e.g. inquiries to establish the background and purpose of complex, unusual large transactions), for at least five years after the business relationship is ended, or after the date of the occasional transaction. Financial institutions should be required by law to maintain records"}

Politically exposed persons * Financial institutions should be required, in relation to foreign politically exposed persons (PEPs) (whether as customer or beneficial owner), in addition to performing normal customer due diligence measures, to: (a) have appropriate risk-management systems to determine whether the customer or the beneficial owner is a politically exposed person; (b) obtain senior management approval for establishing (or continuing, for existing customers) such business relationships; (c) take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and source of funds; and (d) conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship. Financial institutions should be required to take reasonable measures to determine whether a customer or beneficial owner is a domestic PEP or a person who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function by an international organisation. In cases of a h igher risk business relationship with such persons, financial institutions should be required to apply the measures referred to in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d). The requirements for all types of PEP should also apply to family members or close associates of such PEPs. 13. Correspondent banking * Financial institutions should be required, in relation to cross -border correspondent banking and other similar relationships, in addition to performing normal customer due diligence measures, to: (a) gather sufficient information about a respondent institution to understand fully the nature of the respondent’s business and to determine from publicly available information the reputation of the institution and the quality of supervision, including whether it has been subject to a money laundering or terrorist financing investigation or regulatory action; (b) assess the respondent institution’s AML/CFT controls; (c) obtain approval from senior management before establishing new correspondent relationships; (d) clearly understand the respective responsibilities of each institution; and (e) with respect to “payable -through accounts”, be satisfied that the respondent bank has conducted CDD on the customers having direct access to accounts of the correspondent bank, and that it is able to provide relevant CDD information upon request to the correspondent bank."}

Financial institutions should be required to satisfy themselves that respondent institutions do not permit their accounts to be used by shell banks. 14. Money or value transfer services * Countries should take measures to ensure that natural or legal persons that provide money or value transfer services (MVTS) are licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the relevant measures calle d for in the FATF Recommendations. Countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out MVTS without a license or registration, and to apply appropriate sanctions. Any natural or legal person working as an agent should also be licensed or registered by a competent authority, or the MVTS provider should maintain a current list of its agents accessible by competent authorities in the countries in which the MVTS provider and its agents operate. Countries should take measures to ensure that MVTS providers that use agents include them in their AML/CFT programmes and monitor them for compliance with these programmes. 15. New technologies Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the u se of new or developing technologies for both new and pre -existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks. To manage and mitigate the risks emerging from virtual assets, countries should ensure that virtual asset service providers are regulated for AML/CFT purposes, and licensed or registered and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring complian ce with the relevant measures called for in the FATF Recommendations. 16. Payment transparency * Countries should ensure that financial institutions include required and accurate originator information, and required beneficiary information, on payments or value transfers and related messages.

RELIANCE, CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL GROUPS 17. Reliance on third parties * Countries may permit financial institutions to rely on third parties to perform elements (a)-(c) of the CDD measures set out in Recommendation 10 or to introduce business, provided that the criteria set out below are met. Where such reliance is permitted, the ultimate responsibility for CDD measures remains with the financial institution relying on the third party. The criteria that should be met are as follows: (a) A financial institution relying upon a third party should immediately obtain the necessary information concerning elements (a) -(c) of the CDD measures set out in Recommendation 10. (b) Financial institutions should take adequate steps to satisfy themselves that copies of identification data and other relevant documentation relating to the CDD requirements will be made available from the third party upon request without delay. (c) The financial institution should satisfy itself that the third party is regulated, supervised or monitored for, and has measures in place for compliance with, CDD and record keeping requirements in line with Recommendations 10 and 11. (d) When determining in which countries the third party that meets the conditions can be based, countries should have regard to information available on the level of country risk. When a financial institution relies on a third party that is part of the same financial group, and (i) that group applies CDD and record-keeping requirements, in line with Recommendations 10, 11 and 12, and programmes against money laundering and terrorist financing, in accordance with Recommendation 18; and (ii) where the effective implementation of those CDD and record-keeping requirements and AML/CFT programmes is supervised at a group level by a competent authority, then relevant competent authorities may consider that the financial institution applies measures under (b) and (c) above through its group programme, and may decide that (d) is not a necessary precondition to reliance when higher country risk is adequately mitigated by the group AML/CFT policies. 18.

Higher-risk countries * Financial institutions should be required to apply enhanced due diligence measures to business relationships and transactions with natural and legal persons, and financial institutions, from countries for which this is called for by the FATF. The type of enhanced due diligence measures applied should be effective and proportionate to the risks. Countries should be able to apply appropriate countermeasures when called upon to do so by the FATF. Countries should also be able to apply countermeasures independently of any call by the FATF to do so. Such countermeasures should be effective and proportionate to the risks. REPORTING OF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS 20. Reporting of suspicious transactions * If a financial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that funds are the proceeds of a criminal activity, or are related to terrorist financing, it should be required, by law, to report promptly its suspicions to the financial intelligence unit (FIU). 21. Tipping-off and confidentiality Financial institutions, their directors, officers and employees should be: (a) protected by law from criminal and civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by any legislative, regulatory or administrative provision, if they report their suspicions in good faith to the FIU, even if they did not know precisely what the underlying criminal activity was, and regardless of whether illegal activity actually occurred; and (b) prohibited by law from disclosing (“tipping -off”) the fact that a suspicious transaction report (STR) or related information is being filed with the FIU. These provisions are not intended to inhibit information sharing under Recommendation 18. DESIGNATED NON-FINANCIAL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS 22. DNFBPs: customer due diligence * The customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements set out in Recommendations 10, 11, 12, 15, and 17, apply to designated non -financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) in the following situations: (a) Casinos – when customers engage in financial transactions equal to or above the applicable designated threshold."}

Regulation and supervision of financial institutions * Countries should ensure that financial institutions are subject to adequate regulation and supervision and are effectively implementing the FATF Recommendations. Competent authorities or financial supervisors should take the necessary legal or regulatory m easures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a financial institution. Countries should not approve the establishment, or continued operation, of shell banks. For financial institutions subject to the Core Principles, the regulatory and supervisory measures that apply for prudential purposes, and which are also relevant to money laundering and terrorist financing, should apply in a similar manner for AML/CFT pur poses. This should include applying consolidated group supervision for AML/CFT purposes. Other financial institutions should be licensed or registered and adequately regulated, and subject to supervision or monitoring for AML/CFT purposes, having regard to the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing in that sector. At a minimum, where financial institutions provide a service of money or value transfer, or of money or currency changing, they should be licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with national AML/CFT requirements. 27. Powers of supervisors Supervisors should have adequate powers to supervise or monitor, and ensure compliance by, financial institutions with requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, including the authority to conduct inspections. They should be authorised to compel production of any information from financial institutions that is relevant to monitoring such compliance, and to impose sanctions, in line with Recommendation 35, for failure to comply with such requirements. Supervisors should have powers to impose a range of disciplinary and financial sanctions, including the power to withdraw, restrict or suspend the financial institution’s license, where applicable. 28. Regulation and supervision of DNFBPs * Designated non -financial businesses and professions should be subject to regulatory and supervisory measures as set out below. (a) Casinos should be subject to a comprehensive regulatory and supervisory regime that ensures that they have effectively implemented the necessary AML/CFT measures. At a minimum:"}

(b) Countries should ensure that the other categories of DNFBPs are subject to effective systems for monitoring and ensuring compliance with AML/CFT requirements. This should be performed on a risk -sensitive basis. This may be performed by (a) a supervisor or (b) by an appropriate self -regulatory body (SRB), provided that such a body can ensure that its members comply with their obligations to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The supervisor or SRB should also (a) take the necessary measures to prevent criminals or their associates from being professionally accredited, or holding or being the beneficial owner of a significant or controlling interest or holding a management function, e.g. through evaluating persons on the basis of a “fit and proper” test; and (b) have effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions in line with Recommendation 35 available to deal with failure to comply with AML/CFT requirements. OPERATIONAL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 29. Financial intelligence units * Countries should establish a financial intelligence unit (FIU) that serves as a national centre for the receipt and analysis of: (a) suspicious transaction reports; and (b) other information relevant to money laundering, associated predicate offences and terrorist financing, and for the dissemination of the results of that analysis. The FIU should be able to obtain additional information from reporting entities, and should have access on a timely basis to the financial, administrative and law enforcement in formation that it requires to undertake its functions properly. 30. Responsibilities of law enforcement and investigative authorities * Countries should ensure that designated law enforcement authorities have responsibility for money laundering and terrorist financing investigations within the framework of national AML/CFT policies. At least in all cases related to major proceeds -generating offences, these designated law enforcement authorities should develop a pro -active parallel financial investigation when pursuing money laundering, predicate offences and terrorist financing.

Countries should have an adequate legal basis for providing assistance and, where appropriate, should have in place treaties, arrangements or other mechanisms to enhance cooperation. In particular, countries should: (a) Not prohibit, or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on, the provision of mutual legal assistance. (b) Ensure that they have clear and efficient processes for the timely prioritisation and execution of mutual legal assistance requests.

To avoid conflicts of jurisdiction, consideration should be given to devising and applying mechanisms for determining the best venue for prosecution of defendants in the interests of justice in cases that are subject to prosecution in more than one country. Countries should, when making mutual legal assistance requests, make best efforts to provide complete factual and legal information that will allow for timely and efficient execution of requests, including any need for urgency, and should send requests usi ng expeditious means. Countries should, before sending requests, make best efforts to ascertain the legal requirements and formalities to obtain assistance.

Extradition Countries should constructively and effectively execute extradition requests in relation to money laundering and terrorist financing, without undue delay. Countries should also take all possible measures to ensure that they do not provide safe havens for individuals charged with the financing of terrorism, terrorist acts or terrorist organisations. In particular, countries should: (a) ensure money laundering and terrorist financing are extraditable offences; (b) ensure that they have clear and efficient processes for the timely execution of extradition requests including prioritisation where appropriate. To monitor progress of requests a case management system should be maintained; (c) not place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on the execution of requests; and (d) ensure they have an adequate legal framework for extradition. Each country should either extradite its own nationals, or, where a country does not do so solely on the grounds of nationality, that country should, at the request of the country seeking extradition, submit the case, without undue delay, to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution of the offences set forth in the request.

The risk-based approach (RBA) is an effective way to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. In determining how the RBA should be implemented in a sector, countries should consider the capacity and anti -money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) experience of the relevant sector. Countries should understand that the discretion afforded, and responsibility imposed on, financial institutions and designated non -financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs) by the RBA is more a ppropriate in sectors with greater AML/CFT capacity and experience. This should not exempt financial institutions and DNFBPs from the requirement to apply enhanced measures when they identify higher risk scenarios. By adopting a risk -based approach, compet ent authorities, financial institutions and DNFBPs should be able to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are proportionate to the risks identified, and would enable them to make decisions on how to allocate their own resources in the most effective way. 2. In implementing a RBA, financial institutions and DNFBPs should have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The general principle of a RBA is that, where there are higher risks, countries should require financial institutions and DNFBPs to take enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks; and that, correspondingly, where the risks are lower , countries should allow and encourage 2 financial institutions and DNFBPs to take simplified measures. Countries should identify areas of lower risk, for example, through their national or sub-national risk assessments, to support financial institutions and DNFBPs to apply measures proportionate to those risks. Countries should provide guidance or information to financial institutions and DNFBPs on the possible approaches for the implementation of simpl ified measures where the risks are lower. However, s implified measures should not be permitted whenever there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing. Specific Recommendations set out more precisely how this general principle applies to particular requirements. Countries may also, in limited circumstances and where there is an assessed low risk of money laundering and terrorist financing, decide not to apply certain Recommendations to a particular type of financial institution or activity, or"}

In the context of proliferation financing risk, risk-based measures by financial institutions and DNFBPs seek to reinforce and complement the full implementation of the strict requirements of Recommendation 7, by detecting and preventing the non-implementation, potential breach, or evasion of targeted financial sanctions. In determining the measures to mitigate proliferation financing risks in a sector, countries should consider the proliferation financing risks associated with the relevant sector. By adopting risk -based measures, competent authorities, financial institutions and DNFBPs should be able to ensure that these measures are proportionate to the risks identified, and that would enable them to make decisions on how to allocate their own resources in the most effective way. 4. Financial institutions and DNFBPs should have in place processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate proliferation financing risks. 4 This may be done within the framework of their existing targeted financial sanctions and/or compliance programmes.

Countries should criminalise money laundering on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 (the Vienna Convention) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000 (the Palermo Convention). 2. Countries should apply the crime of money laundering to all serious offences, with a view to including the widest range of predicate offences. Predicate offences may be described by reference to all offences; or to a threshold linked either to a categor y of serious offences; or to the penalty of imprisonment applicable to the predicate offence (threshold approach); or to a list of predicate offences; or a combination of these approaches. 3. Where countries apply a threshold approach, predicate offences should, at a minimum, comprise all offences that fall within the category of serious offences under their national law, or should include offences that are punishable by a maximum penalty of more than one year’s imprisonment, or, for those countries that have a minimum threshold for offences in their legal system, predicate offences should comprise all offences that are punished by a minimum penalty of more than six months imprisonment. 4. Whichever approach is adopted, each country should, at a minimum, include a range of offences within each of the designated categories of offences. The offence of money laundering should extend to any type of property, regardless of its value, that directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime. When proving that property is the proceeds of crime, it should not be necessary that a person be convicted of a predicate offence. 5. Predicate offences for money laundering should extend to conduct that occurred in another country, which constitutes an offence in that country, and which would have constituted a predicate offence had it occurred domestically. Countries may provide that the only prerequisite is that the conduct would have constituted a predicate offence, had it occurred domestically. 6. Countries may provide that the offence of money laundering does not apply to persons who committed the predicate offence, where this is required by fundamental principles of their domestic law. 7.

Prioritisation and asset recovery frameworks 1. Countries should review their asset recovery regime to ensure its ongoing effectiveness and provide sufficient resources to effectively pursue asset recovery. 2. Consistent with Recommendation 2, countries should ensure that they have the necessary domestic cooperation and coordination frameworks and agency structures to enable effective use of the measures below. B. Criminal property and property of corresponding value 3. Criminal property and property of corresponding value extends to property owned or held by third parties, but without prejudicing the rights of bona fide third parties. Examples of circumstances where property is owned or held by non-bona fide third parties and could be criminal property or property of corresponding value include: (a) property under the effective control of the defendant or person under investigation and, for example, held or owned by family members, associates or legal persons and arrangements; or (b) where the property has been gifted or transferred to the third party for an amount significantly above or below market value. C. Provisional measures 4. In response to relevant information, countries should enable the FIU or other competent authority to take immediate action, directly or indirectly, to withhold consent to or suspend a transaction suspected of being related to money laundering, predicate offences, or terrorist financing. The maximum duration of this measure should be specified and allow sufficient time to analyse the transaction and for competent authorities to initiate, where appropriate, an action to freeze or seize. 5. Countries should have measures, including legislative measures, to enable their competent authorities to expeditiously carry out provisional measures. This should include: (a) allowing the initial application to freeze or seize criminal property and property of corresponding value to be made ex parte or without prior notice; 7 and (b) ensuring that provisional measures do not have unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions for effective action, such as in relation to demonstrating the risk of dissipation. 7 Ex parte proceedings may be subject to appropriate safeguards under domestic law, including the triggering of notice or an inter partes review after the implementation of the provisional measure."}

When necessary to act as expeditiously as possible, countries should enable competent authorities to freeze and seize criminal property and property of corresponding value without a court order, with such action reviewable through judicial proceedings within a period of time. If either or both freezing or seizing without a court order is inconsistent with fundamental principles of domestic law, a country may use an alternative mechanism if it enables their competent authorities to systematically take action quickly enough to prevent the dissipation of criminal property and property of corresponding value. 7. Countries should have measures, including legislative measures, that enable their competent authorities to take steps that will prevent or void actions that prejudice the country’s ability to freeze or seize or confiscate criminal property and property of corresponding value. D. Confiscation 8. Countries need a comprehensive range of measures, including legislative measures, available to confiscate criminal property and property of corresponding value, including those measures in paragraphs (9)-(13) below. Which measures, or combination of measures, will be applied depends on the circumstances of the case. It is also important for such measures to be implemented in a manner which respects the substantive and procedural rights and safeguards that may be implicated by confiscation. 9. Countries should have measures, including legislative measures, to enable the confiscation of criminal property and property of corresponding value following the conviction of a person. 10.

Countries should have measures, including legislative measures, to enable the confiscation of criminal property without requiring a criminal conviction (non-conviction based confiscation) in relation to a case involving money laundering, predicate offences 10 or terrorism financing, to the extent that such a requirement is consistent with fundamental principles of domestic law.

Countries should consider establishing an asset recovery fund into which all, or a portion of, confiscated property will be deposited for law enforcement, health, education, or other appropriate purposes. 16. Countries should ensure that they have measures that enable them to enforce a confiscation order and realise the property or value subject to the confiscation order, leading to the permanent deprivation of the property or value subject to the order. 17.

Objectives 1. Recommendation 5 was developed with the objective of ensuring that countries have the legal capacity to prosecute and apply criminal sanctions to persons that finance terrorism. Given the close connection between international terrorism and, inter alia , money laundering, another objective of Recommendation 5 is to emphasise this link by obligating countries to include terrorist financing offences as predicate offences for money laundering. B. Characteristics of the terrorist financing offence 2. Terrorist financing offences should extend to any person who wilfully provides or collects funds or other assets by any means, directly or indirectly, with the unlawful intention that they should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part: (a) to carry out a terrorist act(s); (b) by a terrorist organisation; or (c) by an individual terrorist. 3. Terrorist financing includes financing the travel of individuals who travel to a State other than their States of residence or nationality for the purpose of the perpetration, planning, or preparation of, or participation in, terrorist acts or the prov iding or receiving of terrorist training. 4. Criminalising terrorist financing solely on the basis of aiding and abetting, attempt, or conspiracy is not sufficient to comply with this Recommendation. 5. Terrorist financing offences should extend to any funds or other assets, whether from a legitimate or illegitimate source. 6. Terrorist financing offences should not require that the funds or other assets: (a) were actually used to carry out or attempt a terrorist act(s); or (b) be linked to a specific terrorist act(s). 7. Countries should ensure that the intent and knowledge required to prove the offence of terrorist financing may be inferred from objective factual circumstances. 8. Effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal sanctions should apply to natural persons convicted of terrorist financing. 9. Criminal liability and sanctions, and, where that is not possible (due to fundamental principles of domestic law), civil or administrative liability and sanctions, should apply to legal persons. This should not preclude parallel criminal, civil or admin istrative proceedings with respect to legal persons in countries in which more than one form of liability is available.

OBJECTIVE 1. Recommendation 6 requires each country to implement targeted financial sanctions to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions that require countries to freeze, without delay, the funds or other assets, and to ensure that no funds and other assets are made available to or for the benefit of: (i) any person 11 or entity designated by the United Nations Security Council (the Security Council) under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, as required by Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions12; or (ii) any person or entity designated by that country pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). 2. It should be stressed that none of the obligations in Recommendation 6 is intended to replace other measures or obligations that may already be in place for dealing with funds or other assets in the context of a criminal, civil or administrative investigation or proceeding, as is required by Recommendation 4 (confiscation and provisional measures) 13. Measures under Recommendation 6 may complement criminal proceedings against a designated person or entity, and be adopted by a competent authority or a court, but are not conditional upon the existence of such proceedings. Instead, the focus of Recommendation 6 is on the preventive measures that are necessary and unique in the context of stopping the flow of funds or other assets to terrorist groups; and the use of funds or other assets by terrorist groups. In determining the limits of, or fostering widespread support for, an effective counter-terrorist financing regime, countries must also respect human rights, respect the rule of law, and recognise the rights of innocent third parties. 11 Natural or legal person. 12 Recommendation 6 is applicable to all current and future successor resolutions to resolution 1267(1999) and any future UNSCRs which impose targeted financial sanctions in the terrorist financing context. At the time of issuance of this Interpretive Note, (February 2012), the successor resolutions to resolution 1267 (1999) are resolutions: 1333 (2000), 1363 (2001), 1390 (2002), 1452 (2002), 1455 (2003), 1526 (2004), 1617 (2005), 1730 (2006), 1735 (2006), 1822 (2008), 1904 (2009), 1988 (2011), and 1989 (2011). 13 Based on requirements set, for instance, in the United Nations Convention"}

Additionally, the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (1999)(the Terrorist Financing Convention) contains obligations regarding freezing, seizure and confiscation in the context of combating terrorist financing.

There is an obligation for countries to implement targeted financial sanctions without delay against persons and entities designated by the 1267 Committee and 1988 Committee (in the case of resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions), when these Committees are acting under the authority of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. For resolution 1373 (2001), the obligation for countries to take freezing action and prohibit the dealing in funds or other assets of designated persons and entities, without delay, is triggered by a designation at the (supra-)national level, as put forward either on the country’s own motion or at the request of another country, if the country receiving the request is satisfied, according to applicable legal principles, that a requested designation is supported by reasonable grounds, or a reasonable basis, to suspect or believe that the proposed designee meets the criteria for designation in resolution 1373 (2001), as set forth in Section E. 6.

OBJECTIVE 1. Recommendation 7 requires countries to implement targeted financial sanctions 19 to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions that require countries to freeze, without delay, the funds or other assets of, and to ensure that no funds and other assets are made available to, and for the benefit of, any person20 or entity designated by the United Nations Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, pursuant to Security Council resolutions that relate to the prevention and disruption of the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.21 2. It should be stressed that none of the requirements in Recommendation 7 is intended to replace other measures or obligations that may already be in place for dealing with funds or other assets in the context of a criminal, civil or administrative investigation or proceeding, as is required by international treaties or Securi ty Council resolutions relating to weapons of mass destruction non -proliferation. 22 The focus of Recommendation 7 is on preventive measures that are necessary and unique in the context of stopping the flow of funds or other assets to proliferators or proliferation; and the use of funds or other assets by proliferators or proliferation, as required by the United Nations Security Council (the Security Council). 19 Recommendation 7 is focused on targeted financial sanctions. These include the specific restrictions set out in Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) (see Annex B paragraphs 6(c) and (d)). However, it should be noted that the relevant United Nations Security Council Re solutions are much broader and prescribe other types of sanctions (such as travel bans) and other types of financial provisions (such as activity based financial prohibitions, category-based sanctions and vigilance measures). With respect to targeted financial sanctions related to the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other types of financial provisions, the FATF has issued non-binding guidance, which jurisdictions are encouraged to consider in their implementation of the relevant UNSCRs. 20 Natural or legal person. 21 Recommendation 7 is applicable to all current Security Council resolutions applying targeted financial sanctions relating to the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, any future successor resolutions, and any future Security Council resolutions"}

DESIGNATIONS 3. Designations are made by the Security Council in annexes to the relevant resolutions, or by the Security Council Committees established pursuant to these resolutions. There is no specific obligation upon United Nations Member States to submit proposals for designations to the Security Council or the relevant Security Council Committee(s). However, in practice, the Security Council or the relevant Committee(s) primarily depends upon requests for designation by Member States. Security Council resolution 17 18 (2006) provides that the relevant Committee shall promulgate guidelines as may be necessary to facilitate the implementation of the measures imposed by this resolution and its successor resolutions. Resolution 2231 (2015) provides that the Security Coun cil shall make the necessary practical arrangements to undertake directly tasks related to the implementation of the resolution. 4. Countries could consider establishing the authority and effective procedures or mechanisms to propose persons and entities to the Security Council for designation in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions which impose targeted financial s anctions in the context of the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In this regard, countries could consider the following elements: (a) identifying a competent authority(ies), either executive or judicial, as having responsibility for: (i) proposing to the 1718 Sanctions Committee, for designation as appropriate, persons or entities that meet the specific criteria for designation as set forth in resolution 1718 (2006) and its successor resolutions 23, if that authority decides to do so and believes that it has sufficient evidence to support the designation criteria (see Section E for the specific designation criteria associated with relevant Security Council resolutions); and (ii) proposing to the Security Council, for designation as appropriate, persons or entities that meet the criteria for designation as set forth in resolution 2231 (2015) and any future successor resolutions, if that authority decides to do so and believes that it has sufficient evidence to support the designation criteria (see Section E for the specific designation criteria associated with relevant Security Council resolutions). (b) having a mechanism(s) for identifying targets for designation, based on the designation criteria set out in resolutions 1718 (2006), 2231 (2015), and their successor and any future successor resolutions (see Section E for the specific designation criteria of relevant Security Council resolutions).

Countries should develop and implement publicly known procedures to submit de -listing requests to the Security Council in the case of designated persons and entities, that, in the view of the country, do not or no longer meet the criteria for designation.

INTRODUCTION 1. Given the variety of legal forms that non -profit organisations (NPOs) can have, depending on the country, the FATF has adopted a functional definition of an NPO. This definition is based on those activities and characteristics of an organisation which may put it at risk of TF abuse, rather than on the simple fact that it is operating on a non-profit basis. For the purposes of this Recommendation, NPO refers to a legal person or arrangement or organisation that primarily engages in raising or disbursing f unds for purposes such as charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social or fraternal purposes, or for the carrying out of other types of “good works”. Without prejudice to Recommendation 1, this Recommendation only applies to those organisations which fall within the FATF definition of an NPO. It does not apply to the entire universe of organisations working in the not-for-profit realm in a country. 2. NPOs play a vital role in the world economy and in many national economies and social systems. Their efforts complement the activity of the governmental and business sectors in providing essential services, comfort and hope to those in need around the w orld. The FATF recognises the vital importance of NPOs in providing these important services, as well as the difficulty of providing assistance to those in need, including in high -risk areas and conflict zones, and applauds the efforts of NPOs to meet such needs. The FATF also recognises the intent and efforts to date of NPOs to promote transparency within their operations and to prevent terrorist financing abuse, including through the development of programmes aimed at discouraging radicalisation and violent extremism. 3. Some NPOs may be at risk of terrorist financing abuse by terrorists for a variety of reasons. NPOs enjoy public trust, which gives some access to considerable sources of funds, and in some contexts are cash-intensive. Furthermore, some NPOs have a global presence that provides a framework for national and international operations and financial transactions, that may be within or near those areas that are most exposed to terrorist activity.

In rare cases, terrorist organisations have taken advantage of these and other characteristics to infiltrate NPOs and misuse funds and operations to cover for, or support, terrorist activity. Also, there have been cases where terrorists create sham NPOs or engage in fraudulent fundraising for these purposes. The ongoing international campaign against terrorist financing has identified cases in which terrorists and terrorist organisations exploit some NPOs in the sector to raise and move funds, provide logistical support, encourage terrorist recruitment, or otherwise support terrorist organisations and operations. This misuse not only facilitates terrorist activity, but also undermines the confidence of donors and financial institutions and jeopardises the very integrity of NPOs. 4. Therefore, protecting NPOs from terrorist financing abuse is both a critical component of the global effort to prevent and combat terrorism and a necessary step to preserve the integrity of NPOs, the donor community and the financial institutions they use .

OBJECTIVES AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES 5. The objective of Recommendation 8 is to ensure that NPOs are not ab used by terrorist s and terrorist organisations: (i) to pose as legitimate entities; (ii) to exploit legitimate entities as conduits for terrorist financing, including for the purpose of escaping asset freezing measures; or (iii) to conceal or obscure the clandestine diversion of funds intended for legitimate purposes, but diverted for terrorist purposes. In this Interpretive Note, the approach taken to achieve this objective is based on the following general principles: (a) Past and ongoing terrorist financing abuse of NPOs requires countries to have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures in dealing with identified risks. A riskbased approach is essential given the diversity within individual national sectors, the differing degrees to which parts of each sector may be at risk of terrorist financing abuse, the need to ensure that legitimate NPO activity continues to flourish, and the limited resources and authorities available to combat terrorist financing in each country. (b) Flexibility in developing a national response to terrorist financing abuse of NPOs is essential, in order to allow it to evolve over time as it faces and responds to the changing nature of the terrorist financing threat. (c) Focused, proportionate and risk-based measures adopted by countries to protect NPOs from terrorist financing abuse should not unduly disrupt or discourage legitimate NPO activities, in line with the risk-based approach. Rather, such measures should promote accountability and engender greater confidence among NPOs, across the donor community, the financial institutions and with the general public, that NPO funds and services reach intended legitimate beneficiaries. Systems that promote achieving a high degree of accountability, integr ity and public confidence in the management and functioning of NPOs are integral to ensuring they cannot be abused for terrorist financing. (d) Countries should identify and take effective and proportionate action against NPOs that either are exploited by, or are knowingly supporting, terrorists or terrorist organisations, taking into account the specifics of the case. Countries should aim to prevent and prosecute, as appropriate, terrorist financing and other forms of terrorist support. Where NPOs suspected of,"}

Actions taken for this purpose must respect the rule of law and should, to the extent reasonably possible, minimise negative impact on innocent and legitimate beneficiaries of NPO activity. However, this interest cannot excuse the need to undertake immediate and effective actions to advance the immediate 30 See also UNSC resolution 2462(2019) paras 6 and 23 and UNSC resolution 2664(2022) para.1."}

(e) Countries should develop an understanding of the different degrees of TF risk posed to NPOs and of the corresponding proportionate measures to mitigate these risks in line with the risk -based approach. Many NPOs may face low TF risk exposure, may have adequate self-regulatory measures and related internal control measures to mitigate such risks, and/or may already be subject to adequate levels of legal and regulatory requirements, such that there may be no need for additional measures. 31 Countries should be mindful of the potential impact of measures on legitimate NPO activities and apply them where they are necessary to mitigate the assessed TF risks, without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities. It is not in line with Recommendation 8 to apply measures to organisations working in the not -for-profit realm to protect them from TF abuse when they do not fall within the FATF’s functional definition of NPOs. It is not in line with Recommendation 8 to implement any measures that are not proportionate to the assessed TF risks, and are th erefore overly burdensome or restrictive. NPOs are not reporting entities and should not be required to conduct customer due diligence. (f) Developing cooperative relationships among the public and private sectors and with NPOs is critical to understanding NPOs’ risks and risk mitigation strategies, raising awareness, increasing effectiveness and fostering capabilities to combat terrorist financing abuse within NPOs. Countries should encourage the development of academic research on, and information -sharing in, NPOs to address terrorist financing related issues. C. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATING MEASURES 6. NPOs are at varying degrees of risk of TF abuse by virtue of their types, activities or characteristics and the majority may represent low risk. Without prejudice to the requirements of Recommendation 1: (a) Countries should identify organisations which fall within the FATF definition of NPOs. (b) Countries should conduct a risk assessment of these NPOs to identify the nature of TF risks posed to them. (c) Countries should have in place focused, proportionate and risk -based measures to address the TF risks identified, in line with the risk-based approach. Countries may also consider, where they exist, self- regulatory measures and related internal control measures in place within"}

EFFECTIVE APPROACH IN IDENTIFYING, PREVENTING AND COMBATING TF ABUSE OF NPOS 7. There is a diverse range of approaches in identifying, preventing and combating terrorist financing abuse of NPOs. For NPOs identified to be at low-risk of TF abuse, countries may focus only on undertaking outreach concerning terrorist financing issues, and may decide to refrain from taking additional mitigating measures. In other situations, an effective approach should involve all four of the following elements to protect NPOs from potential terrorist financing abuse., without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities: (a) Sustained outreach concerning terrorist financing issues: (i) Countries should have clear policies to promote accountability, integrity and public confidence in the administration and management of NPOs. (ii) Countries should undertake outreach and educational programmes as appropriate to raise and deepen awareness among NPOs as well as the donor community about the potential vulnerabilities of NPOs to terrorist financing abuse and terrorist financing risks, and the measures that NPOs can take to protect themselves against such abuse. (iii) Countries should work with NPOs to develop and refine best practices to address terrorist financing risks and thus protect them from terrorist financing abuse. (iv) Countries should encourage NPOs to conduct transactions via regulated financial and payment channels, wherever feasible, keeping in mind the varying capacities of financial sectors in different countries and areas and the risks of using cash. (b) Focused, proportionate and risk-based measures, including oversight or monitoring of NPOs: Countries should take steps to promote focused, proportionate and risk-based oversight or monitoring of NPOs . A “one-size-fits-all” approach would be inconsistent with the proper implementation of a risk -based approach as stipulated under Recommendation 1 of the FATF Standards. In practice: (i) Countries should be able to demonstrate that they have in place focused, proportionate and risk-based measures applying to NPOs. It is also possible that existing regulatory and self -regulatory measures and related internal control 32 For example, such information could be provided by regulators, tax authorities, FIUs, donor organisations or law enforcement"}

(ii) Appropriate authorities should monitor the compliance of NPOs with the focused, proportionate and risk-based measures being applied to them. (iii) Appropriate authorities should be able to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for violations by NPOs or persons acting on behalf of these NPOs. 33 (c) Effective information gathering and investigation: (i) Countries should ensure effective cooperation, coordination and information sharing to the extent possible among all levels of appropriate authorities or organisations that hold relevant information on NPOs. (ii) Countries should have investigative expertise and capability to examine those NPOs suspected of either being exploited by, or actively supporting, terrorist activity or terrorist organisations. (iii) Countries should ensure that access to relevant information on the administration and management of a particular NPO (including financial and programmatic information) may be obtained during the course of an investigation. (iv) Countries should establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure that, when there is suspicion or reasonable grounds to suspect that a particular NPO: (1) is involved in terrorist financing abuse and/or is a front for fundraising by a terrorist organisation; (2) is being exploited as a conduit for terrorist financing, including for the purpose of escaping asset freezing measures, or other forms of terrorist support; or (3) is concealing or obscuring the clandestine diversion of funds intended for legitimate purposes, but redirected for the benefit of terrorists or terrorist organisations, that this information is promptly shared with relevant competent authorities, in order to take preventive or investigative action. (d) Effective capacity to respond to international requests for information about an NPO of concern: c onsistent with Recommendations on international cooperation, countries should identify appropriate points of contact and procedures to respond to international requests for information regarding particular NPOs suspected of terrorist financing or involvement in other forms of terrorist support. 33 The range of such sanctions might include freezing of accounts, removal of trustees, fines, de-certification, de-licensing and de -registration. This should not preclude parallel civil, administrative or criminal proceedings with respect to NPOs or persons acting on their behalf where appropriate."}

CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE AND TIPPING-OFF 1. If, during the establishment or course of the customer relationship, or when conducting occasional transactions, a financial institution suspects that transactions relate to money laundering or terrorist financing, then the institution should: (a) normally seek to identify and verify the identity 34 of the customer and the beneficial owner, whether permanent or occasional, and irrespective of any exemption or any designated threshold that might otherwise apply; and (b) make a suspicious transaction report (STR) to the financial intelligence unit (FIU), in accordance with Recommendation 20. 2. Recommendation 21 prohibits financial institutions, their directors, officers and employees from disclosing the fact that an STR or related information is being reported to the FIU. A risk exists that customers could be unintentionally tipped off when t he financial institution is seeking to perform its customer due diligence (CDD) obligations in these circumstances. The customer’s awareness of a possible STR or investigation could compromise future efforts to investigate the suspected money laundering or terrorist financing operation. 3. Therefore, if financial institutions form a suspicion that transactions relate to money laundering or terrorist financing, they should take into account the risk of tipping-off when performing the CDD process. If the institution reasonably believes that performing the CDD process will tip-off the customer or potential customer, it may choose not to pursue that process, and should file an STR. Institutions should ensure that their employees are aware of, and sensitive to, these issues when conducting CDD. B. CDD – PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF A CUSTOMER 4. When performing elements (a) and (b) of the CDD measures specified under Recommendation 10, financial institutions should also be required to verify that any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer is so authorised, and should identify and verify the identity of that person. C. CDD FOR LEGAL PERSONS AND ARRANGEMENTS 5. When performing CDD measures in relation to customers that are legal persons or legal arrangements35, financial institutions should be required to identify and verify the identity of the customer, and understand the nature of its business, and its ownership and control 34 Reliable, independent source documents, data or information will hereafter be referred to as “identification data.” 35 In these"}

The purpose of the requirements set out in (a) and (b) below, regarding the identification and verification of the customer and the beneficial owner, is twofold: first, to prevent the unlawful use of legal persons and arrangements, by gaining a sufficient understanding of the customer to be able to properly assess the potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks associated with the business relationship; and, second, to take appropriate steps to mitigate the risks. As two aspects of o ne process, these requirements are likely to interact and complement each other naturally. In this context, financial institutions should be required to: (a) Identify the customer and verify its identity. The type of information that would normally be needed to perform this function would be: (i) Name, legal form and proof of existence – verification could be obtained, for example, through a certificate of incorporation, a certificate of good standing, a partnership agreement, a deed of trust, or other documentation from a reliable independent source proving the name, form and current existence of the customer. (ii) The powers that regulate and bind the legal person or arrangement (e.g. the memorandum and articles of association of a company), as well as the names of the relevant persons having a senior management position in the legal person or arrangement (e.g. senior managing directors in a company, trustee(s) of a trust). (iii) The address of the registered office, and, if different, a principal place of business. (b) Identify the beneficial owners of the customer and take reasonable measures 36 to verify the identity of such persons, through the following information: (i) For legal persons37: (i.i) The identity of the natural persons (if any – as ownership interests can be so diversified that there are no natural persons (whether acting alone or together) exercising control of the legal person or arrangement through ownership) who ultimately h ave a controlling ownership interest 38 in a legal person; and (i.ii) to the extent that there is doubt under (i.i) as to whether the person(s) with the controlling ownership interest are the beneficial owner(s) or where no natural person exerts control through ownership interests, the identity of the natural persons (if any) exercising control of the legal person or arrangement through other means. 36 In determining the reasonableness"}

(ii) For legal arrangements: (ii.i) Trusts – the identity of the settlor, the trustee(s), the protector (if any), the beneficiaries or class of beneficiaries 39 , and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust (including through a chain of control/ownership); (ii.ii) Other types of legal arrangements – the identity of persons in equivalent or similar positions.

The relevant identification data may be obtained from a public register, from the customer or from other reliable sources. D. CDD FOR BENEFICIARIES OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES 6. For life or other investment -related insurance business, financial institutions should, in addition to the CDD measures required for the customer and the beneficial owner, conduct the following CDD measures on the beneficiary(ies) of life insurance and other investment related insurance policies, as soon as the beneficiary(ies) are identified/designated: (a) For beneficiary(ies) that are identified as specifically named natural or legal persons or legal arrangements – taking the name of the person; (b) For beneficiary(ies) that are designated by characteristics or by class (e.g. spouse or children at the time that the insured event occurs) or by other means (e.g. under a will) – obtaining sufficient information concerning the beneficiary to satisfy t he financial institution that it will be able to establish the identity of the beneficiary at the time of the payout.

The beneficiary of a life insurance policy should be included as a relevant risk factor by the financial institution in determining whether enhanced CDD measures are applicable. If the financial institution determines that a beneficiary who is a legal person or a legal arrangement presents a higher risk, then the enhanced CDD measures should include reasonable measures to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owner of the beneficiary, at the time of payout. 9. Where a financial institution is unable to comply with paragraphs 6 to 8 above, it should consider making a suspicious transaction report. E. RELIANCE ON IDENTIFICATION AND VERIFICATION ALREADY PERFORMED 10. The CDD measures set out in Recommendation 10 do not imply that financial institutions have to repeatedly identify and verify the identity of each customer every time that a customer conducts a transaction. An institution is entitled to rely on the ide ntification and verification steps that it has already undertaken, unless it has doubts about the veracity of that information. Examples of situations that might lead an institution to have such doubts could be where there is a suspicion of money launderin g in relation to that customer, or where there is a material change in the way that the customer’s account is operated, which is not consistent with the customer’s business profile. F. TIMING OF VERIFICATION 11. Examples of the types of circumstances (in addition to those referred to above for beneficiaries of life insurance policies) where it would be permissible for verification to be completed after the establishment of the business relationship, because it would be essential not to interrupt the normal conduct of business, include:  Non face-to-face business.  Securities transactions. In the securities industry, companies and intermediaries may be required to perform transactions very rapidly, according to the market conditions at the time the customer is contacting them, and the performance of the transaction may be required before verification of identity is completed. 12. Financial institutions will also need to adopt risk management procedures with respect to the conditions under which a customer may utilise the business relationship prior to verification. These procedures should include a set of measures, such as a li mitation of the number, types and/or amount of transactions that can be performed and"}

The examples are not intended to be comprehensive, and although they are considered to be helpful indicators, they may not be relevant in all circumstances. Higher risks 15. There are circumstances where the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing is higher, and enhanced CDD measures have to be taken. When assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to types of customers, countries or geograph ic areas, and particular products, services, transactions or delivery channels, examples of potentially higherrisk situations (in addition to those set out in Recommendations 12 to 16) include the following: (a) Customer risk factors:  The business relationship is conducted in unusual circumstances (e.g. significant unexplained geographic distance between the financial institution and the customer).  Non-resident customers.  Legal persons or arrangements that are personal asset-holding vehicles.  Companies that have nominee shareholders or shares in bearer form.  Business that are cash-intensive.  The ownership structure of the company appears unusual or excessively complex given the nature of the company’s business. (b) Country or geographic risk factors:42  Countries identified by credible sources, such as mutual evaluation or detailed assessment reports or published follow-up reports, as not having adequate AML/CFT systems.  Countries subject to sanctions, embargos or similar measures issued by, for example, the United Nations.  Countries identified by credible sources as having significant levels of corruption or other criminal activity.  Countries or geographic areas identified by credible sources as providing funding or support for terrorist activities, or that have designated terrorist organisations operating within their country. (c) Product, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors: 41 The RBA does not apply to the circumstances when CDD should be required but may be used to determine the extent of such measures. 42 Under Recommendation 19 it is mandatory for countries to require financial institutions to apply enhanced due diligence when the FATF calls for such measures to be introduced."}

Lower risks 16. There are circumstances where the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing may be lower. In such circumstances, and provided there has been an adequate analysis of the risk by the country or by the financial institution, the country should allow and encourage 43 its financial institutions to apply simplified CDD measures. 17. When assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to types of customers, countries or geographic areas, and particular products, services, transactions or delivery channels, examples of potentially lower risk situations include the following: (a) Customer risk factors:  Financial institutions and DNFBPs – where they are subject to requirements to combat money laundering and terrorist financing consistent with the FATF Recommendations, have effectively implemented those requirements, and are effectively supervised or monitored in accordance with the Recommendations to ensure compliance with those requirements.  Public companies listed on a stock exchange and subject to disclosure requirements (either by stock exchange rules or through law or enforceable means), which impose requirements to ensure adequate transparency of beneficial ownership.  Public administrations or enterprises. (b) Product, service, transaction or delivery channel risk factors:  Life insurance policies where the premium is low (e.g. an annual premium of less than USD/EUR 1,000 or a single premium of less than USD/EUR 2,500).  Insurance policies for pension schemes if there is no early surrender option and the policy cannot be used as collateral.  A pension, superannuation or similar scheme that provides retirement benefits to employees, where contributions are made by way of deduction from wages, and the scheme rules do not permit the assignment of a member’s interest under the scheme. 43 For example, encouragement can take the form of guidance issued by the government, supervisor or other competent authority to improve understanding of the circumstances when simplified measures may be appropriate and what form they may take, or outreach or other forms of engagement with financial institutions and DNFBPs."}

(c) Country risk factors:  Countries identified by credible sources, such as mutual evaluation or detailed assessment reports, as having effective AML/CFT systems.  Countries identified by credible sources as having a low level of corruption or other criminal activity. In making a risk assessment, countries or financial institutions could, when appropriate, also take into account possible variations in money laundering and terrorist financing risk between different regions or areas within a country. 18. Having a lower money laundering and terrorist financing risk for identification and verification purposes does not automatically mean that the same customer is lower risk for all types of CDD measures, in particular for ongoing monitoring of transactions. Risk variables 19. When assessing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks relating to types of customers, countries or geographic areas, and particular products, services, transactions or delivery channels risk, a financial institution should take into account risk variables relating to those risk categories. These variables, either singly or in combination, may increase or decrease the potential risk posed, thus impacting the appropriate level of CDD measures. Examples of such variables include:  The purpose of an account or relationship.  The level of assets to be deposited by a customer or the size of transactions undertaken.  The regularity or duration of the business relationship. Enhanced CDD measures 20. Financial institutions should examine, as far as reasonably possible, the background and purpose of all complex, unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent economic or lawful purpose. Where the risks of money laundering or terrorist financing are higher, financial institutions should be required to conduct enhanced CDD measures, consistent with the risks identified. In particular, they should increase the degree and nature of monitoring of the business relationship, in order to determine whether those transactions or activities appear unusual or suspicious. Examples of enhanced CDD measures that could be applied for higher-risk business relationships include:  Obtaining additional information on the customer (e.g. occupation, volume of assets, information available through public databases, internet, etc.), and updating more regularly the identification data of customer and beneficial owner."}

Simplified CDD measures 21. Where the risks of money laundering or terrorist financing are lower, financial institutions should be allowed and encouraged to implement simplified CDD measures, which should take into account the nature of the lower risk. The simplified measures should be proportionate to the lower risk factors (e.g. the simplified measures could relate to customer acceptance measures, aspects of ongoing monitoring, or both). Examples of possible measures are:  Verifying the identity of the customer and the beneficial owner after the establishment of the business relationship (e.g. if account transactions rise above a defined monetary threshold).  Reducing the frequency of customer identification updates.  Reducing the degree of on-going monitoring and scrutinising transactions, based on a reasonable monetary threshold.  Not collecting specific information or carrying out specific measures to understand the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship, but inferring the purpose and nature from the type of transactions or business relationship established.

For the purposes of applying the FATF Recommendations, countries should consider virtual assets as “property,” “proceeds,” “funds,” “funds or other assets,” or other “corresponding value.” Countries should apply the relevant measures under the FATF Recommendations to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) 2. In accordance with Recommendation 1, countries should identify, assess, and understand the money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks 44 emerging from virtual asset activities and the activities or operations of VASPs. Based on that assessment, countries should apply a risk -based approach to ensure that measures to prevent or mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing are proportionate to the risks identified. Countries should take appropriate steps to manage and mitigate the proliferation financing risks that they identify. Countries should require VASPs to identify, assess, and take effective action to mitigate their money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing risks. 3. VASPs should be required to be licensed or registered. At a minimum, VASPs should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction(s) where they are created 45. In cases where the VASP is a natural person, they should be required to be licensed or registered in the jurisdiction where their place of business is located. Jurisdictions may also require VASPs that offer products and/or services to customers in, or conduct operations from, their jurisdiction to be licensed or registered in this jurisdiction. Competent authorities should take the necessary legal or regulatory measures to prevent criminals or their associates from holding, or being the beneficial owner of, a significant or controlling interest, or holding a management function in, a VASP. Countries should take action to identify natural or legal persons that carry out VASP activities without the requisite license or registration, and apply appropriate sanctions. 4.

OBJECTIVE 1. Recommendation 16 has the objective of preventing terrorists , perpetrators of money laundering and associated predicate offences (e.g., fraud), and other criminals from having unfettered access to payments or value transfers for moving their funds, and for detecting such misuse when it occurs. Specifically, it aims to ensure that basic information on the originator and beneficiary48 of payments or value transfers is immediately available: (a) to appropriate law enforcement and/or prosecutorial authorities to assist them in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting terrorists or other criminals, and tracing their assets; (b) to financial intelligence units for analysing suspicious or unusual activity, and disseminating it as necessary, and (c) to ordering, intermediary and beneficiary financial institutions to facilitate the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions, and to implement the requirements to take freezing action and comply with prohibitions from conducting transactions with designated persons and entities, as per the obligations set out in the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, such as resolution 1267 (1999) and its successor resolutions, and resolution 1373 (2001) relating to the prevention and suppression of terrorism and terrorist financing , and resolutions relating to the prevention, suppression and disruption of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. 49 2. To accomplish these objectives, countries should have the ability to trace all payments or value transfers. Due to the potential terrorist financing threat posed by small payments or value transfers, countries should minimise thresholds , while taking into account the risk of driving transactions underground and the importance of financial inclusion. It is not the intention of the FATF to impose rigid standards or to mandate a single operating process that would negatively affect the payment system or financial inclusion. B. SCOPE 3. Recommendation 16 applies to cross -border and domestic payments or value transfers, including serial payments and cover payments. Differentiated obligations apply to different types of transactions, as set out in Section C. 48 The terms \"originator\" and \"beneficiary\" are used in Recommendation 16 and its Interpretive Note. These terms are interchangeable with the terms \"debtor\" and \"creditor\" respectively, which are used in certain messaging standards such as ISO 20022. 49 Recommendation 16 does not specify whether or how the information transmitted should be screened against"}

Information accompanying cross-border and domestic payments or value transfers should be structured, to the extent possible, in accordance with the established standards of the system used such as ISO 20022, and should be sufficiently detailed to enable id entification of the originator and beneficiary. C. INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS 5. This section sets out the applicable information requirements for domestic and cross- border transfers including differentiated requirements for certain categories of payments or value transfers. 6. For purposes of implementation of Recommendation 16, the payment chain starts at the financial institution that receives the instructions from the originator for transfer of funds to the beneficiary. The end point of the payment chain is the financial institution that services the account of the beneficiary or provides cash to the beneficiary. 7. Information in the payment message should make it possible for all institutions and authorities referred to in paragraph 1 to identify which financial institution is servicing the account of the originator and beneficiary respectively and in which countrie s these institutions are located. Financial institutions should ensure that account numbers should not be used to disguise the identification of the country where the financial institution that services the account resides. Cross-border payments and value transfers De-minimis threshold for cross-border payments and value transfers 8. Countries may adopt a de minimis threshold (no higher than USD/EUR 1 000) for cross-border payments or value transfers (other than cash withdrawals). B elow this threshold, countries should ensure that financial institutions include with such transfers: (a) the name of the originator and beneficiary; and (b) the account number of the originator and beneficiary, where such an account is used to process the transaction. 50 In the absence of an account, a unique transaction reference number should be included, which permits traceability of the transaction. Such information need not be verified for accuracy, unless there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, in which case, the financial institution should verify the information pertaining to its customer. Payments and value transfers above the de minimis threshold 9 Information accompanying all cross -border payments or value transfers above the applicable threshold should always contain: (a) the name of the originator and beneficiary; 50 In cases where the funds are drawn from a financial institution other than the"}

Domestic payments and value transfers De-minimis threshold for domestic payments or value transfers 10. Countries may also adopt a de minimis threshold (no higher than USD/EUR 1 000), for domestic payments or value transfers. Below this threshold, countries should ensure that financial institutions include with such transfers: (a) the name of the originator; and (b) the account number of the originator, or a unique transaction reference number which will permit the transaction to be traced back to the originator or the beneficiary. Such information need not be verified for accuracy, unless there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing, in which case, the financial institution should verify the information pertaining to its customer.

Information accompanying domestic p ayments or value transfers should include originator information as indicated in paragraph 9 for cross-border payments or value transfers (or in paragraph 10 above for payments and value transfers below the threshold) , unless this information can be made available to the beneficiary financial institution and appropriate authorities by other means. In this latter case, the ordering financial institution need only include the account number or a unique transaction refere nce number, pro vided that this number or identifier will permit the transaction to be traced back to the originator or the beneficiary. 12.

Law enforcement authorities should be able to compel immediate production of such information. Exceptions and Differentiated Requirements Financial institution-to-financial institution transfers, net settlements and batch transactions 13. No information is required to accompany financial institution-to-financial institution transfers and settlements, where both the originator and the beneficiary are financial institutions acting on their own behalf. 14. The settlement of payment or value transfers may happen under a net settlement arrangement. Where any net settlement results from payments or value transfers transactions carried out on behalf of customers, information about the underlying transactions is not required to accompany the net settlement. Nevertheless, the relevant requirements of Recommendation 16 do apply to the underlying transactions themselves. 15. Where several individual cross-border payments or value transfers from a single originator are bundled in a batch file for transmission to beneficiaries they may be exempted from the requirements of paragraph s 8 and 9 in respect of originator information, provided that they include the originator’s account number or unique transaction reference number (as described in paragraph 9(b)), and the batch file contain s required and accurate originator information, and full beneficiary information, that is fully traceable within the beneficiary country. Card payments 16. With respect to any transfers that flow from a transaction carried out using a credit or debit or prepaid card for the purchase of goods or services, 54 the credit or debit or prepaid card number should accompany all transfers flowing from the transaction and the name and location of the card issuing and merchant acquiring financial institutions 55 should be made available upon request.56 17. When a credit or debit or prepaid card is used to effect other types of payment or value transfer (e.g., a person -to-person transfer), the transaction is subject to the applicable requirements above for domestic or cross-border payments or value transfers. Cash withdrawals 18. No information beyond the account number or card number is required to accompany domestic cash withdrawals. 54 The purchase of goods or services refers to purchases from individuals/entities who are onboarded by the relevant financial institution to accept card payments following the required CDD in respect of such activity. 55 Card issuer and merchant acquirer information should make it possible for all institutions and authorities referred to"}

D. RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORDERING, INTERMEDIARY AND BENEFICIARY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS58 INCLUDING MVTS59 Ordering (debtor) financial institution 20. The ordering financial institution should ensure that cross-border payments or value transfers above the de minimis threshold contain required and accurate originator information, and required beneficiary information. 21. The ordering financial institution should ensure that cross-border payments or value transfers below the de minimis threshold contain the name of the originator and the beneficiary and an account number for each, or a unique transaction reference number. 22. The ordering financial institution should maintain all originator and beneficiary information collected, in accordance with Recommendation 11. 23. The ordering financial institution should not be allowed to execute the payments or value transfer if it does not comply with the requirements specified above. Intermediary financial institution 24.

For cross -border payments or value transfers above the de minimis threshold, information received on the intended beneficiary should inform beneficiary financial institution's monitoring, with the objective of detecting misdirected payments (e.g. due to po ssible money laundering, fraud, or error). Beneficiary financial institutions should take measures to mitigate the risk of transfers being made to an unintended beneficiary. Such measures should include at least one of the following (a), (b), or (c): (a) the beneficiary financial institution should, for each transaction, check the extent to which the name and account number of the beneficiary in the payment message aligns 60 with the information held by the beneficiary financial institution; or (b) the beneficiary financial institution should conduct holistic ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous accounts, transactions, and activity, including misaligned beneficiary information, following a risk-based approach; or (c) if the beneficiary and ordering financial institutions both participate in a pre validation mechanism such as confirmation/verification of payee to check, for each transaction, that the name and account number of the beneficiary in the payment message aligns with the information held by the beneficiary financial institution, then this pre-validation may be used instead of (a) or (b) above. 31.

The reference to criminal activity in Recommendation 20 refers to all criminal acts that would constitute a predicate offence for money laundering or, at a minimum, to those offences that would constitute a predicate offence, as required by Recommendation 3. Countries are strongly encouraged to adopt the first of these alternatives. 2. The reference to terrorist financing in Recommendation 20 refers to: the financing of terrorist acts and also terrorist organisations or individual terrorists, even in the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act or acts. 3. All suspicious transactions, including attempted transactions, should be reported regardless of the amount of the transaction. 4. The reporting requirement should be a direct mandatory obligation, and any indirect or implicit obligation to report suspicious transactions, whether by reason of possible prosecution for a money laundering or terrorist financing offence or otherwise (so called “indirect reporting”), is not acceptable."}

For the purposes of R.23, the requirements referring to ‘financial groups’ in R.18 apply to DNFBP groups operating under the same structure as financial groups. In addition, countries should consider applying the requirements for group -wide programmes to DNFBPs operating in other structures sharing common ownership, management or compliance control to the extent that those structures could better mi tigate ML/TF risks by applying group -wide programmes. The type and extent of measures to be taken should be appropriate to the business conducted, the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing and the size of the business.

BASIC INFORMATION 3. In order to determine who the beneficial owners of a company66 are, competent authorities will require certain basic information about the company, which, at a minimum, would include information about the legal ownership and control structure of the company. This would include information about the status and powers of the company, its shareholders and its directors. 4. All companies created in a country should be registered in a company registry. 67 Whichever combination of mechanisms is used to obtain and record beneficial ownership information (see section B), there is a set of basic information on a company that needs to be obtained and recorded by the company68 as a necessary prerequisite. The minimum basic information to be obtained and recorded by a company should be: (a) company name, proof of incorporation, legal form and status, the address of the registered office, basic regulating powers (e.g. memorandum & articles of association), a list of directors, and unique identifier such as a tax identification number or equivalent (where this exists); 69 and (b) a register of its shareholders or members, containing the names of the shareholders and members and number of shares held by each shareholder 70 and categories of shares (including the nature of the associated voting rights). 5. The company registry71 should record all the basic information set out in paragraph 4(a) above. 6. The company should maintain the basic information set out in paragraph 4(b) within the country, either at its registered office or at another location notified to the company registry. However, if the company or company registry holds beneficial ownersh ip information within the country, then the register of shareholders need not be in the country, provided that the company can provide this information promptly on request.

The extent of verification measures may vary according to the specific level of risk. • Up-to-date information is information which is as current and up -to-date as possible, and is updated within a reasonable period following any change. 7 Countries should ensure that competent authorities, and in particular law enforcement authorities and FIUs , should have all the powers necessary to obtain timely access to the information held by trustees , persons holding equivalent positions in similar legal arrangements, and other parties, in particular information held by financial institutions and DNFBPs on: (a) the basic and beneficial ownership of the legal arrangement; (b) the residence of the trustee s and their equivalents ; and (c) any assets held or managed by the financial institution or DNFBP, in relation to any truste es or their equivalents with which they have a business relationship, or for which they undertake an occasional transaction. 8. Trustees and persons holding equivalent positions in similar legal arrangements should be required to maintain the information referred to in paragraph 1 for at least five years after their involvement with the trust or similar legal arrangement ceases. Countries are encouraged to require the other authorities, persons and entities mentioned in paragraph 5 above to maintain the information for at least five years. 9 Countries should require that any information held pursuant to paragraph 1 above should be kept accurate and up -to-date, and the information should be updated within a reasonable period following any change. 88 For beneficiary(ies) of trusts/similar legal arrangement that are"}

Countries should consider measures to facilitate access to information that is held on trusts or other similar legal arrangements by the other authorities, persons and entities referred to in paragraph 5, by financial institutions and DNFBPs undertaking the requirements set out in Recommendations 10 and 22. 11. In the context of this Recommendation, countries are not required to give legal recognition to trusts. Countries need not include the requirements of paragraphs 1, 4, 8, 9 and 13 in legislation, provided that appropriate obligations to such effect exist for trustees (e.g. through common law or case law). International Cooperation 12 Countries should rapidly, constructively and effectively provide international cooperation in relation to information, including beneficial ownership information, on trusts and other legal arrangements on the basis set out in Recommendations 37 and 40. Th is should include (a) facilitating access by foreign competent authorities to any information held by registries or other domestic authorities; (b) exchanging domestically available information on the trusts or other legal arrangement; and (c) using their competent authorities’ powers, in accordance with domestic law, in order to obtain beneficial ownership information on behalf of foreign counterparts. Consistent with Recommendations 37 and 40, countries should not place unduly restrictive conditions on the exchange of information or assistance e.g., refuse a request on the grounds that it involves fiscal (including tax ) matters, bank secrecy, etc. T o facilitate rapid, constructive and effective international cooperation, where possible, countries should designate and make publicly known the agency(ies ) responsible for responding to all international requests for beneficial ownership information, consistent with countries’ approach to access to beneficial ownership information. To this end, countries should consider keeping information held or obtained for the purpose of identifying beneficial ownership in a readily accessible manner. Liability and Sanctions 13. Countries should ensure that there are clear responsibilities to comply with the requirements in this Interpretive Note; and that trustees or persons holding equivalent positions in similar legal arrangements are either legally liable for any failure to perform the duties relevant to meeting the obligations in paragraphs 1, 4, 8 and 9 ; or that there are effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal, civil or administrative, for failing to comply. 90 Countries should ensure that there are effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether"}

Risk-based approach to supervision refers to: (a) the general process by which a supervisor, according to its understanding of risks, allocates its resources to AML/CFT supervision; and (b) the specific process of supervising institutions that apply an AML/CFT risk-based approach. 2. Adopting a risk -based approach to supervising financial institutions’ AML/CFT systems and controls allows supervisory authorities to shift resources to those areas that are perceived to present higher risk. As a result, supervisory authorities can use their resources more effectively. This means that supervisors: (a) should have a clear understanding of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks present in a country; and (b) should have on-site and off-site access to all relevant information on the specific domestic and international risks associated with customers, products and services of the supervised institutions, including the quality of the compliance function of the financial institution or group. The frequency and intensity of on-site and off -site AML/CFT supervision of financial institutions/groups should be based on the money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and the policies, internal controls and procedures associated with the institution/group, as identified by the supervisor’s assessment of the institution/group’s risk profile, and on the money laundering and terrorist financing risks present in the country. 3. The assessment of the money laundering and terrorist financing risk profile of a financial institution/group, including the risks of non-compliance, should be reviewed both periodically and when there are major events or developments in the management and operations of the financial institution/group, in accordance with the country’s established practices for ongoing supervision. This assessment should not be static: it will change depending on how circumstances develop and how threats evolve. 4. AML/CFT supervision of financial institutions/groups that apply a risk-based approach should take into account the degree of discretion allowed under the RBA to the financial institution/group, and encompass, in an appropriate manner, a review of the risk assessments underlying this discretion, and of the adequacy and implementation of its policies, internal controls and procedures. 5. These principles should apply to all financial institutions/groups.

Risk-based approach to supervision refers to: (a) the general process by which a supervisor or SRB, according to its understanding of risks, allocates its resources to AML/CFT supervision; and (b) the specific process of supervising or monitoring DNFBPs that apply an AML/CFT riskbased approach. 2. Supervisors or SRBs should determine the frequency and intensity of their supervisory or monitoring actions on DNFBPs on the basis of their understanding of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and taking into consideration the character istics of the DNFBPs, in particular their diversity and number, in order to ensure effective AML/CFT supervision or monitoring. This means having a clear understanding of the money laundering and terrorist financing risks: (a) present in the country; and (b) associated with the type of DNFBP and their customers, products and services. 3. Supervisors or SRBs assessing the adequacy of the AML/CFT internal controls, policies and procedures of DNFBPs should properly take into account the money laundering and terrorist financing risk profile of those DNFBPs, and the degree of discretion allowed to them under the RBA. 4. Supervisors or SRBs should have adequate powers to perform their functions (including powers to monitor and sanction), and adequate financial, human and technical resources.

GENERAL 1. This note explains the core mandate and functions of a financial intelligence unit (FIU) and provides further clarity on the obligations contained in the standard. The FIU is part of, and plays a central role in, a country’s AML/CFT operational network, and provides support to the work of other competent authorities. Considering that there are different FIU models, Recommendation 29 does not prejudge a country’s choice for a particular model, and applies equally to all of them. B. FUNCTIONS (a) Receipt 2. The FIU serves as the central agency for the receipt of disclosures filed by reporting entities. At a minimum, this information should include suspicious transaction reports, as required by Recommendation 20 and 23, and it should include other informati on as required by national legislation (such as cash transaction reports, wire transfers reports and other threshold-based declarations/disclosures). (b) Analysis 3. FIU analysis should add value to the information received and held by the FIU. While all the information should be considered, the analysis may focus either on each single disclosure received or on appropriate selected information, depending on the type and volume of the disclosures received, and on the expected use after dissemination. FIUs should be encouraged to use analytical software to process information more efficiently and assist in establishing relevant links. However, such tools cannot fully replace the human judgement element of analysis. FIUs should conduct the following types of analysis:  Operational analysis uses available and obtainable information to identify specific targets (e.g. persons, assets, criminal networks and associations), to follow the trail of particular activities or transactions, and to determine links between those targets and possible proceeds of crime, money laundering, predicate offences or terrorist financing.  Strategic analysis uses available and obtainable information, including data that may be provided by other competent authorities, to identify money laundering and terrorist financing related trends and patterns. This information is then also used by the FIU or other state entities in order to determine money laundering and terrorist financing related threats and vulnerabilities. Strategic analysis may also help establish policies and goals for the FIU, or more broadly for other entities within the AML/CFT regime."}

The FIU should be able to disseminate, spontaneously and upon request, information and the results of its analysis to relevant competent authorities. Dedicated, secure and protected channels should be used for the dissemination.  Spontaneous dissemination: The FIU should be able to disseminate information and the results of its analysis to competent authorities when there are grounds to suspect money laundering, predicate offences or terrorist financing. Based on the FIU’s analysis, the dissemination of information should be selective and allow the recipient authorities to focus on relevant cases/information.  Dissemination upon request: The FIU should be able to respond to information requests from competent authorities pursuant to Recommendation 31. When the FIU receives such a request from a competent authority, the decision on conducting analysis and/or dissemination of information to the requesting authority should remain with the FIU. C. ACCESS TO INFORMATION (a) Obtaining Additional Information from Reporting Entities 5. In addition to the information that entities report to the FIU (under the receipt function), the FIU should be able to obtain and use additional information from reporting entities as needed to perform its analysis properly. The information that the FIU should be permitted to obtain could include information that reporting entities are required to maintain pursuant to the relevant FATF Recommendations (Recommendations 10, 11 and 22). (b) Access to Information from other sources 6. In order to conduct proper analysis, the FIU should have access to the widest possible range of financial, administrative and law enforcement information. This should include information from open or public sources, as well as relevant information collected and/or maintained by, or on behalf of, other authorities and, where appropriate, commercially held data. D. INFORMATION SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 7. Information received, processed, held or disseminated by the FIU must be securely protected, exchanged and used only in accordance with agreed procedures, policies and applicable laws and regulations. An FIU must, therefore, have rules in place governing the security and confidentiality of such information, including procedures for handling, storage, dissemination, and protection of, as well as access to such information. The FIU should ensure that its staff members have the necessary security clearance levels and understanding of their responsibilities in handling and disseminating sensitive and confidential information. The FIU should ensure that there is"}

OPERATIONAL INDEPENDENCE 8. The FIU should be operationally independent and autonomous, meaning that the FIU should have the authority and capacity to carry out its functions freely, including the autonomous decision to analyse, request and/or disseminate specific information. In all cases, this means that the FIU has the independent right to forward or disseminate information to competent authorities. 9. An FIU may be established as part of an existing authority. When a FIU is located within the existing structure of another authority, the FIU’s core functions should be distinct from those of the other authority. 10. The FIU should be provided with adequate financial, human and technical resources, in a manner that secures its autonomy and independence and allows it to conduct its mandate effectively. Countries should have in place processes to ensure that the staff of the FIU maintain high professional standards, including standards concerning confidentiality, and should be of high integrity and be appropriately skilled. 11. The FIU should also be able to make arrangements or engage independently with other domestic competent authorities or foreign counterparts on the exchange of information. F. UNDUE INFLUENCE OR INTERFERENCE 12. The FIU should be able to obtain and deploy the resources needed to carry out its functions, on an individual or routine basis, free from any undue political, government or industry influence or interference, which might compromise its operational independence. G. EGMONT GROUP 13. Countries should ensure that the FIU has regard to the Egmont Group Statement of Purpose and its Principles for Information Exchange Between Financial Intelligence Units for Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Cases (these documents set out import ant guidance concerning the role and functions of FIUs, and the mechanisms for exchanging information between FIUs). The FIU should apply for membership in the Egmont Group. H. LARGE CASH TRANSACTION REPORTING 14. Countries should consider the feasibility and utility of a system where financial institutions and DNFBPs would report all domestic and international currency transactions above a fixed amount."}

There should be designated law enforcement authorities that have responsibility for ensuring that money laundering, predicate offences and terrorist financing are properly investigated through the conduct of a financial investigation. Countries should a lso designate one or more competent authorities to identify, trace, and initiate freezing and seizing of criminal property and property of corresponding value. 2. A ‘financial investigation’ means an enquiry into the financial affairs related to criminal activity, with a view to:  identifying the extent of criminal networks and/or the scale of criminality;  identifying and tracing criminal property and property of corresponding value; and  developing evidence which can be used in criminal and/or confiscation proceedings. 3. A ‘parallel financial investigation’ refers to conducting a financial investigation alongside, or in the context of, a (traditional) criminal investigation into money laundering, terrorist financing and/or predicate offence(s). Law enforcement investigators of predicate offences should either be authorised to pursue the investigation of any related money laundering and terrorist financing offences during a parallel investigation, or be able to refer the case to another agency to follow up with such investigations. 4. Countries should consider taking measures, including legislative ones, at the national level, to allow their competent authorities investigating money laundering and terrorist financing cases to postpone or waive the arrest of suspected persons and/or t he seizure of the money, for the purpose of identifying persons involved in such activities or for evidence gathering. Without such measures the use of procedures such as controlled deliveries and undercover operations are precluded. 5. Recommendation 30 also applies to those competent authorities, which are not law enforcement authorities, per se , but which have the responsibility for pursuing financial investigations of predicate offences, to the extent that these competent authorities are exercising functions covered under Recommendation 30. 6. Anti-corruption enforcement authorities with enforcement powers may be designated to investigate money laundering and terrorist financing offences arising from, or related to, corruption offences under Recommendation 30, and these authorities should also h ave sufficient powers to identify, trace, and initiate freezing and seizing of criminal property and property of corresponding value. 7.

OBJECTIVES 1. Recommendation 32 was developed with the objective of ensuring that terrorists and other criminals cannot finance their activities or launder the proceeds of their crimes through the physical cross- border transportation of currency and bearer negotiable in struments. Specifically, it aims to ensure that countries have measures to: (a) detect the physical cross border transportation of currency and bearer negotiable instruments; (b) stop or restrain currency and bearer negotiable instruments that are suspected to be related to terrorist financing or money laundering; (c) stop or restrain currency or bearer negotiable instruments that are falsely declared or disclosed; (d) apply appropriate sanctions for making a false declaration or disclosure; and (e) enable confiscation of currency or bearer negotiable instruments that are related to terrorist financing or money laundering. B. THE TYPES OF SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CASH COURIERS 2. Countries may meet their obligations under Recommendation 32 and this Interpretive Note by implementing one of the following types of systems. However, countries do not have to use the same type of system for incoming and outgoing cross- border transportation of currency or bearer negotiable instruments: Declaration system 3. All persons making a physical cross- border transportation of currency or bearer negotiable instruments (BNIs), which are of a value exceeding a pre- set, maximum threshold of USD/EUR 15,000, are required to submit a truthful declaration to the designated competent authorities. Countries may opt from among the following three different types of declaration system: (i) a written declaration system for all travellers; (ii) a written declaration system for those travellers carrying an amount of currency or BNIs above a threshold; and (iii) an oral declaration system. These three systems are described below in their pure form. However, it is not uncommon for countries to opt for a mixed system. (a) Written declaration system for all travellers: In this system, all travellers are required to complete a written declaration before entering the country. This would include questions contained on common or customs declaration forms. In practice, travellers have to make a declaration whether or not they are carrying currency or BNIs (e.g. ticking a “yes” or “no” box). (b) Written declaration system for travellers carrying amounts above a threshold:"}

(b) Written declaration system for travellers carrying amounts above a threshold: In this system, all travellers carrying an amount of currency or BNIs above a pre-set designated threshold are required to complete a written declaration form. In practice, the traveller is not required to fill out any forms if they are not carrying curre ncy or BNIs over the designated threshold."}

Usually, this is done at customs entry points by requiring travellers to choose between the “red channel” (goods to declare) and the “green channel” (nothing to declare). The choice of channel that the traveller makes is considered to be the oral declaration. In practice, travellers do not declare in writing, but are required to actively report to a customs official. Disclosure system 4. Countries may opt for a system whereby travellers are required to provide the authorities with appropriate information upon request. In such systems, there is no requirement for travellers to make an upfront written or oral declaration. In practice, travellers need to be required to give a truthful answer to competent authorities upon request. C. ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH SYSTEMS 5. Whichever system is implemented, countries should ensure that their system incorporates the following elements: (a) The declaration/disclosure system should apply to both incoming and outgoing transportation of currency and BNIs. (b) Upon discovery of a false declaration/disclosure of currency or bearer negotiable instruments or a failure to declare/disclose them, designated competent authorities should have the authority to request and obtain further information from the carrier with regard to the origin of the currency or BNIs and their intended use. (c) Information obtained through the declaration/disclosure process should be available to the FIU, either through a system whereby the FIU is notified about suspicious cross border transportation incidents, or by making the declaration/disclosure informat ion directly available to the FIU in some other way. (d) At the domestic level, countries should ensure that there is adequate coordination among customs, immigration and other related authorities on issues related to the implementation of Recommendation 32. (e) In the following two cases, competent authorities should be able to stop or restrain cash or BNIs for a reasonable time, in order to ascertain whether evidence of money laundering or terrorist financing may be found: (i) where there is a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing; or (ii) where there is a false declaration or false disclosure.

(g) Countries should implement Recommendation 32 subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without restricting either: (i) trade payments between countries for goods and services; or (ii) the freedom of capital movements, in any way. D. SANCTIONS 6. Persons who make a false declaration or disclosure should be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal civil or administrative. Persons who are carrying out a physical cross -border transportation of currency or BNIs that is related to terrorist financing, money laundering or predicate offences should also be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, whether criminal, civil or administrative, and shoul d be subject to measures, consistent with Recommendation 4, which would enable the confiscation of such currency or BNIs. 7. Authorities responsible for implementation of Recommendation 32 should have adequate financial, human and technical resources. Countries should have in place processes to ensure that the staff of these authorities maintain high professional standards, including standards concerning confidentiality, and should be of high integrity and be appropriately skilled. E. GOLD, PRECIOUS METALS AND PRECIOUS STONES 8. For the purposes of Recommendation 32, gold, precious metals and precious stones are not included, despite their high liquidity and use in certain situations as a means of exchange or transmitting value. These items may be otherwise covered under customs laws and regulations. If a country discovers an unusual cross-border movement of gold, precious metals or precious stones, it should consider notifying, as appropriate, the Customs Service or other competent authorities of the countries from which these items originated and/or to which they are destined, and should cooperate with a view toward establishing the source, destination, and purpose of the movement of such items, and toward the taking of appropriate action.

Countries should be able to take expeditious action in response to requests for cooperation in the widest possible range of circumstances. This should include requests made on the basis of conviction and non- conviction based confiscation proceedings and related provisional measures, as set out in Recommendation 4.91 2. In recognising and enforcing foreign freezing, seizing or confiscation orders, requested countries should be able to rely on the findings of fact in the foreign order. Enforcement should not be made conditional on conducting a domestic investigation. F urther, courts in the requested country may review the foreign order and issue any orders necessary to give it effect with regard to property located in the requested country. 3. Where the requested country requires a court order to provide assistance due to fundamental principles of domestic law or other considerations, requesting countries should ensure that their courts have authority to issue freezing, seizing, and confiscation orders for property located abroad or, if applicable, mechanisms for domestic judicial review and validation of orders to be submitted for enforcement. 4. Countries should also ensure they have the authority to provide further related assistance on an initial request, without requiring a supplemental request, in appropriate cases. 5. Countries should have effective mechanisms for managing, preserving, and, when necessary, disposing of, frozen, seized or confiscated property as set out in Recommendation 4. 6. Countries should be able to share confiscated property with other countries, in particular, when confiscation is directly or indirectly a result of coordinated law enforcement actions. Countries should be able to make arrangements, where appropriate, to deduct or share sub stantial or extraordinary costs incurred when enforcing a freezing, seizing, or confiscation order. 7. Countries should have measures to enable informal communication with other countries in asset recovery cases, including facilitating assistance before a request is made and updating countries, as appropriate, on the status of their requests. 91 The reference to Recommendation 4 incorporates references to fundamental principles of domestic law which may relate to certain types of confiscation.

PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL FORMS OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Obligations on requesting authorities 1. When making requests for cooperation, competent authorities should make their best efforts to provide complete factual and, as appropriate, legal information, including indicating any need for urgency, to enable a timely and efficient execution of the request, as well as the foreseen use of the information requested. Upon request, requesting competent authorities should provide feedback to the requested competent authority on the use and usefulness of the information obtained. Unduly restrictive measures 2. Countries should not prohibit or place unreasonable or unduly restrictive conditions on the provision of exchange of information or assistance. In particular competent authorities should not refuse a request for assistance on the grounds that: (a) the request is also considered to involve fiscal matters; and/or (b) laws require financial institutions or DNFBPs (except where the relevant information that is sought is held in circumstances where legal privilege or legal professional secrecy applies) to maintain secrecy or confidentiality; and/or (c) there is an inquiry, investigation or proceeding underway in the requested country, unless the assistance would impede that inquiry, investigation or proceeding; and/or (d) the nature or status (civil, administrative, law enforcement, etc.) of the requesting counterpart authority is different from that of its foreign counterpart.

Countries should ensure that the FIU or other competent authority is able to take immediate action, directly or indirectly, to withhold consent to or suspend a transaction suspected of being related to money laundering, predicate offences, or terrorist financing, in response to a relevant request from a foreign counterpart. If the competent authorities having this power in the requesting and the requested countries are not counterparts, countries should ensure that the FIU is able to send or receive such requests.

All requirements for financial institutions, DNFBPs or VASPs should be introduced either (a) in law (see the specific requirements in Recommendations 10, 11 and 20 in this regard), or (b) for all other cases, in law or enforceable means (the country has discretion). 2. In Recommendations 10, 11 and 20, the term “law” refers to any legislation issued or approved through a Parliamentary process or other equivalent means provided for under the country’s constitutional framework, which imposes mandatory requirements with sanctions for non compliance. The sanctions for no n-compliance should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see Recommendation 35). The notion of law also encompasses judicial decisions that impose relevant requirements, and which are binding and aut horitative in all parts of the country. 3. The term “Enforceable means” refers to regulations, guidelines, instructions or other documents or mechanisms that set out enforceable AML/CFT requirements in mandatory language with sanctions for non-compliance, and which are issued or approved by a competent authority. The sanctions for non -compliance should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see Recommendation 35). 4. In considering whether a document or mechanism has requirements that amount to enforceable means, the following factors should be taken into account: (a) There must be a document or mechanism that sets out or underpins requirements addressing the issues in the FATF Recommendations, and providing clearly stated requirements which are understood as such. For example: (i) if particular measures use the word shall or must, this should be considered mandatory; (ii) if they use should, this could be mandatory if both the regulator and the regulated institutions demonstrate that the actions are directly or indirectly required and are being implemented; language such as measures are encouraged , are recommended or institutions should consider is less likely to be regarded as mandatory. In any case where weaker language is used, there is a presumption that the language is not mandatory (unless the country can demonstrate otherwise).

(c) There must be sanctions for non -compliance (sanctions need not be in the same document that imposes or underpins the requirement, and can be in another document, provided that there are clear links between the"}
